// ─── naming/barrel-discoverability ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Every PUBLIC barrel lists each name it exports, with the same name
// the definition has. To learn what a module offers, you read the one barrel
// file, not the files below it. A search for a public name finds the
// definition, and a search for the definition finds the callers.
//
// Which files those are is derived from the tree's vocabulary — one barrel per
// unit of each subdivided directory — and it must not widen past them. Inside a
// module, a wildcard or an alias changes nothing that code outside the module
// can find. A check on every file then reports on correct code.
//
// A walk that matches no file is not an error, and that is this check's loudest
// blind spot: a tree whose barrels are somewhere the vocabulary does not
// describe reports clean while reading no barrel at all.
//
// `export { default as Button }` is a finding, and so is a type-only rename. Do
// not add an exception for either — a boolean that skips a branch is the branch
// deleted, one config line at a time. Do not add an exception for
// `default`. A default export has no name to search for, so the barrel holds
// the only name of that symbol. Give the definition the name.
//
// A bare `export default` is the other half of that and is NOT reported: there
// is no second name to compare it against, so the rename branch has nothing to
// say about it. The symbol is nameless at the boundary all the same, and no
// check in the catalog reports that.
//
// What a barrel says is read from `import-scanning.ts`'s export record — the
// tier's one reader of an export clause — and that decides this check's blind
// spots as much as the globs do. A surface spelled `module.exports = …` has no
// export record, so it is not read here and no rule in the catalog asks whether
// it is greppable. Nothing is matched against the source text: an `export *`
// written in a comment or inside a string is not an export, and the grammar
// settles that rather than a scrubbing pass.
//
// What a barrel reaches through its re-exports is api/barrel-purity's finding,
// not this one's.
