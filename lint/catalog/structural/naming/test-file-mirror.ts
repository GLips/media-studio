// Shows: The tests that a search for their source module does not find. A test
// that carries the name of its source comes back in that same search. Then you
// see the test that constrains a module before you change the module. This
// check only warns, thus the project can keep a test name that no search
// connects to its source.
//
// This is the one check whose subject is a file that every other check skips,
// thus it is the one caller of `collectTreeFiles` with `includeTests`. A person
// who makes this walk the same as the other walks deletes that option. The
// check then reads no test files and stays green.
//
// That option waives the TEST exemption and no other. A generated directory, an
// ambient declaration and a script stay invisible here, because a test inside
// one of them is still a file nobody wrote — a rename this check asks for is an
// edit to a generator's output that the next run undoes.
//
// The check never asks if a source file has a test. Tests must earn their
// place, and many modules correctly have none. A rule that demands a test here
// makes people add test files with no assertions.
//
// `base` comes from `absolute`, not from `sourcePath`, although every line
// around it uses `sourcePath`. `existsSync` on a source-root-relative path
// tests the current directory, and then each mirrored test becomes an orphan
// report.
