// ─── health/doc-budgets ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Every doc in the manifest is at or below its word ceiling, and
// each ceiling is no more than 5% above the word count. When you add a
// paragraph to a budgeted doc, the same commit makes you cut one, move the
// text, or raise the number. You do not have to check whether CLAUDE.md is
// still short enough for an agent to read all of it.
//
// A doc below its ceiling can still fail. A ceiling only moves down on its own.
// Do not delete the slack status to let a small doc pass. The words between a
// doc and an old ceiling are words the next agent adds with no manifest diff.
//
// countWords counts tables, code fences and front matter. Do not make the count
// more exact with a Markdown parse that skips fenced blocks. A count that skips
// fences moves the text into fences.
//
// There is no pragma and no per-file override. A ceiling inside the doc lets one
// edit add both the words and the permission for them. Then no manifest diff
// exists for a person to approve.
//
// A manifest that is absent or does not parse is an error. Do not make it an
// empty run. One typo in manifestPath leaves every doc uncounted while the check
// reports clean. The fixture tree cannot test this branch: it holds one
// manifest, and every other case needs that manifest to parse. Zero entries is
// not an error: a project with no budgeted docs yet ships an empty manifest and
// stays registered, so the check starts governing the first doc the manifest
// names rather than waiting for someone to remember it exists.
