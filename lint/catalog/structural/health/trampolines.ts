// Shows: each exported function in a target layer whose body has no variable,
// no branch, and no try or throw. Such a function usually only forwards a call,
// so you delete it or you write `export { repoFn as serviceFn }`. Then a change
// to the repo function is an edit to one file, not two.
//
// The layer, and not the body text, decides the result. The same body is a finding
// under service/ and correct under repo/, where a thin wrapper on a query is the
// job. Thus the check walks layer roots, and repo is never a target layer.
//
// This reads two forms: `export function` and a method of an exported object
// literal. It does not read an exported arrow function
// (`export const name = () => …`). Add that shape here if it appears. A form
// the extractor does not find gets no finding, and a reader then believes the
// file is correct.
