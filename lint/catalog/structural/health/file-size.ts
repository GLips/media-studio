// ─── health/file-size ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Every source file in the configured roots is shorter than
// failThreshold lines. You can read a complete file before you change one
// function in it. No file grows so large that you must plan the split as
// separate work.
//
// Count every line: code, comments and blank lines. Do not add a parser that
// skips imports, type declarations or comments. A file with 300 lines of code
// and 300 lines of comments is still 600 lines for a person to read. A count
// of logical lines selects almost the same files.
//
// Keep two thresholds and two severities. The gap between them lets a person
// finish a change and split the file in the same commit. One threshold stops
// the work in the middle of the change. If the hard limit reports a warning,
// an agent continues past it and the file keeps its size.
//
// There is no per-file pragma and no exclusion list. A comment in the file puts
// the exemption in the file that grew, where nobody reads it again — and a
// central list is the same thing spread over a config: it grows by one entry per
// commit that would otherwise have failed, each with a TODO nobody returns to,
// until the threshold describes the files nobody had a reason to exempt. The
// thresholds are the knob. A project whose files are legitimately longer raises
// them, in one place, visibly.
//
// Do not make an exclusion match a directory. A directory that produces large
// files again and again is the result you want to see.
