# health — Code quality metrics

The whole-tree half. Set thresholds from the codebase, not the defaults. One that fires on a third
of the repo on day one teaches everyone the linter cries wolf, which costs you the boundary rules
too. The per-file half is one rule about comment length:
[../../oxlint/health/overview.md](../../oxlint/health/overview.md). Nested-ternary depth is not a
rule in either half — the shipped `no-nested-ternary` owns it, enabled in `setup/oxlintrc.json`.

| Rule | Blocking | What it buys |
|---|---|---|
| [doc-budgets](doc-budgets.ts) | Yes | Every doc in the manifest is at or below its word ceiling, and no ceiling is more than 5% above the count |
| [file-size](file-size.ts) | Mixed | Every source file in the configured roots is shorter than `failThreshold` lines |
| [trampolines](trampolines.ts) | No | Each exported function in a target layer whose body has no variable, no branch, and no try or throw |

`doc-budgets` governs only the docs its manifest names. It does not search for markdown files, so a
new doc has no ceiling until a person adds an entry. No other rule closes that hole. Budget the
standing docs: CLAUDE.md and the `docs/architecture/` files that agents read on every task. Plans,
ADRs and changelogs grow by design and belong outside the manifest.

`doc-budgets` and `file-size` are PROJECT-scoped, and they are the only two checks in the tier that
are — `trampolines` runs per declared tree like everything else. Everything else
runs once per declared tree; a file's length and a document's word count are not positions in an
architecture, so neither reads a tree at all. `file-size`'s `roots` are therefore its own list rather
than the declared trees — it measures any package you name, including code no boundary rule reads.
Leave `roots` at the default and a sibling package you believe is covered gets no result. There is
no exclusion list to go with the thresholds: a per-file pass is how a size limit becomes advisory,
so a project whose files are legitimately longer raises the numbers instead.

`trampolines` reports legitimate functions. A call through a telemetry helper, a seam held for a
test fake, and a function that grows in the next commit all look the same to it. It warns, and a
person makes the decision. It reads only `export function` and the methods of an
`export const obj = {…}`. A project that writes its services as exported arrow functions gets no
findings at all. It scans the layers named by `targetLayerRoles`, which defaults to the service
role — a role rather than a directory name, so a tree that calls the layer something else is scanned
without a second list to keep in step. Never add the repo role: a thin wrapper on a query is the job
of that layer, so the check then reports all of it.

Adoption mechanics, the spec contract, and what part of the tree owns each rule's subject: [../../overview.md](../../overview.md).
