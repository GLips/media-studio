// ─── The structural-check orchestrator ────────────────────────────────
//
// Runs every registered check against one config and owns everything the checks
// deliberately do not: reporting, warning suppression, and the exit code.
//
// A check that exits on its own hides every check after it, so checks RETURN
// findings and this decides what they mean. The same argument applies to a check
// that throws, which is why each one runs inside its own try: an unreadable file
// in `style/css-tokens` must not take `graph/domain-cycles` silent with it, and
// "this check crashed" has to arrive as a loud error rather than as an empty
// result indistinguishable from a clean one.
//
// ── Adapt ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Point it at the project's config and wire it into the pre-commit hook and CI.
//
// Run the two tiers so that BOTH run and the worst status wins. `oxlint && node
// check-structure.ts` is the same defect this file exists to avoid, one level
// up: oxlint failing means the structural tier never runs, and a tier that never
// ran is indistinguishable from a clean one in the output.
//
// Go through `lint/with-real-node.sh` rather than a bare `node`. A bare `node`
// is whatever the spawning shell put on PATH, and under Bun that is Bun wearing
// node's name — which walks a different set of files than CI does. The launcher
// explains itself; the point here is that the recipe is where the mistake gets
// copied from.
