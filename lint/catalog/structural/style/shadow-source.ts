// ─── style/shadow-source ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Only one file declares a shadow: the file that `allowedFile`
// names. To change how a shadow looks, you edit one named entry in that file.
// To see all of the shadows in the project, you read that one file and not
// each stylesheet and each component.
//
// Do not move this check to the lint tier. oxlint does not parse a .css file,
// and a stylesheet is where most shadows are. A rule that reads only the .tsx
// files reports nothing about the stylesheets, and the sentence above becomes
// false.
//
// The word boundaries in the two patterns are necessary. `shadowRoot`, a
// `data-shadow` attribute and a `.shadow-panel` class name are all correct code.
// A wider pattern fails a commit on correct code, and then people disable the
// check.
//
// Do not add an escape for a `styles` or an `sx` prop. A person asks for it
// about one week after you add this rule. If a component can write a shadow
// through a prop, the file is no longer the complete list. No person can
// test the first sentence by a read of one file.
//
// Keep the severity at error. With a warning, the number of violations
// increases, and the file that people still name as the complete list is not
// complete.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE: the two spellings are the WEB ones. A React Native project
// writes `shadowColor` / `shadowOffset` / `shadowRadius`, and this check says
// nothing about any of them — the file it names as the complete inventory is
// complete for `box-shadow` and `boxShadow` alone. Adding those spellings is a
// change to this catalog, not a config field: what counts as a shadow IS this
// check, and as a regex knob it was one `/a^/` away from reporting nothing while
// still reading as enabled.

// knob, and it is read from the shared list rather than restated: a second copy
// here drifts SILENTLY and in one direction, classifying newly-added source
// extensions as stylesheets and reporting them clean.
//
// The scan itself takes every stylesheet extension the tree declares plus every
// source extension the catalog knows, so "what is read" is not a knob either: a
// list of scanned extensions can be emptied, and an empty one is a check that
// walks nothing and reports clean.
