// ─── api/barrel-purity ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: No client-safe barrel in domains/*/index.ts or features/*/index.ts
// reaches a server-only package through its re-exports. A client component or a
// route file can import any barrel, and you do not first read the chain below it.
// When a chain does reach one, the finding at commit time names the barrel to
// change, not the last package in a build log.
//
// This check does not use the resolved import graph. Graph resolution discards
// bare package specifiers as "not a boundary question", and bare package names
// are the subject of this check. It reads the two modules under the graph
// instead — scanDeclaredImports for the extraction, context.resolveModule for
// the resolution — rather than a second answer to either. Do not resolve a hop here: a suffix list
// against the disk cannot substitute `./target.js` for `target.ts`, and a hop it
// cannot follow ends the trace and reports the barrel clean.
//
// TYPE-ONLY imports are dropped here, and that is a position rather than a
// limit: a type import makes no runtime code and cannot put a package in a
// client bundle. The scanner reports them, marked, because the import graph
// needs them; this check filters them out. A mixed re-export
// (export { type Foo, bar } from "…") stays, because bar is a runtime dependency.
//
// ── The server-function boundary: a stated approximation ─────────────────────
//
// The trace stops at a module that crosses the framework's server-function
// boundary, because the compiler cuts the chain there. Deciding whether a given
// module crosses it is a question about SYNTAX — which name an import bound,
// whether the call reaches that binding or a shadow — and this check answers it
// by reading text. What follows is that approximation and its contract. The
// approximation is a CHOICE, not a limit: `import-scanning.ts` parses, so the
// binding is there for a check willing to spend it. Read the contract as what
// holds while none has.
//
// IN — recognised as a boundary. A named import of one of the boundary's calls
// from the boundary's module, read as `imported as local` so the alias direction
// is not guessable, plus a call of that local name in the body, plus no
// binding-shaped occurrence of that name anywhere else in the file. A namespace
// import counts, as `NS.createServerFn`.
//
// OUT — deliberately not recognised, and OUT MEANS THE TRACE CONTINUES. Every
// omission here is an over-report: a chain the framework would have cut, reported
// as a blocking error. That is the safe direction and it is chosen. A boundary
// reached through a local re-export is out. A file that imports the boundary for
// real and also mentions the name in a binding-shaped position — `{ createServerFn }`
// in an object literal, the name passed as an argument — reads as having rebound
// it and is out. A rest binding is out, and `rebindsName` says why.
//
// NEVER — the direction that would be a false NEGATIVE, a server-only package in
// the client bundle behind a green run. No spelling is accepted as a boundary
// without an import of the boundary's own module, and that half is not
// approximated at all: it is `scanDeclaredImports`, the same parse the import
// graph runs on. Text that merely LOOKS like an import — in a string, in JSX
// text, in a comment — is not in the parser's answer and cannot fabricate a
// boundary. `rebindsName` is one-sided for the same reason: any doubt about which
// binding runs resolves to "not a boundary", never to "boundary".
//
// WHY IT STAYS AN APPROXIMATION. `placement/no-plain-export-in-server-fn-module`
// reads the same syntax EXACTLY, with a real AST: it decides bridge-ness from the
// initializer's call chain, and it reports four of the six shadow fixtures below
// on its own. It does NOT report `impostor` or `sconce`, whose exports ARE
// bridge-shaped chains over a name that is not the framework's — the two cases
// where the binding, not the shape, is the whole question. So it cannot be the
// only owner, and neither can it be replaced by this: its subject is one file and
// the consumer of this answer is a cross-file trace the oxlint tier cannot run.
// The two are jointly actionable — that rule says "make this export a bridge or
// move it", this one says "move the export to the server barrel or put it behind
// a server function", and following either never violates the other.
//
// So this is a second, deliberately WEAKER reading of a question another rule
// owns exactly. Treat further OUT-clause bypasses of it as the known
// approximation this paragraph names, not as bugs to patch one spelling at a
// time. What is NOT dispositioned that way is a NEVER-clause bypass, and the
// split between the two halves is what makes them different kinds of finding:
// the module half is a parse and admits no spelling, the name half is text and
// admits many. A bypass of the name half moves the file OUT — an over-report. A
// bypass of the module half would be a false negative, and the module half has no
// hand-written reader to bypass.
//
// Folding the name half into the parse is the obvious next move and is not taken
// here: `entries[].localName` gives the binding exactly, and what stands in the
// way is a rewrite of the four regexes below rather than any dependency
// question. Until someone does it, the contract above is what holds, and the
// direction of its failure is why that is tolerable.
