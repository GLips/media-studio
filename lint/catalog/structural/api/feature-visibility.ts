// ─── api/feature-visibility ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Every import from one feature into another, WITHIN one declared
// tree, has an entry in the importee's visibility.json, with a written reason. To find every feature that
// depends on feature B, you read one file in B, not the whole repository. To add
// a dependency on B, you must edit B, so the diff shows the decision.
//
// Do not move the grants into one central file, and do not derive them from
// tags. Both find the same edges. An edit to a config file the author already
// has open looks like part of the task. An edit inside another feature does
// not. The rule depends on that difference.
//
// A grant names a feature, not a barrel and not a path. One entry covers the
// client barrel and index.server. Grants are not transitive: "A grants B" plus
// "B grants C" permits no edge between A and C.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE: the graph this reads is ONE declared tree's. `buildImportGraph`
// drops an edge whose other end resolves outside the tree it was built for, so a
// feature in `apps/web/src` importing a feature in `packages/core/src` needs no
// grant and gets no finding — in either tree's run. Cross-tree coupling is real
// and nothing in this tier reports it.
//
// Stale grants are warnings, and the orchestrator hides warnings for files a
// commit did not stage. The case this arm exists for — an importer that drops
// its last import — stages nothing in the importee. Run this check in CI as
// well as in the pre-commit hook, or you do not see that case.
//
// A cycle of granted edges is graph/feature-deps's finding, not this one's. No
// grant makes a cycle legal.
//
// The enumeration is every DIRECTORY under features/, and a symlink is not one.
// So a name that resolves to a directory no enumerated feature is — a link to
// vendored code, to a hoisted package, or to a directory inside another feature
// — is a feature the deny arm audits alone, under the LINK name. Three
// consequences, and only the first is covered:
//
//   - Its grant file is read, so the edge is denied, cleared by a grant written
//     at the link, and reported when that file does not parse. All three come
//     from the edge, so an unparseable grant file is reported only while
//     something still imports the feature. `broken`'s equivalent is reported
//     whether or not anything does, and that asymmetry is not worth a second
//     walk: the sentence says every import of the feature is unaudited, and with
//     no importer there is nothing to say.
//   - A grant there that has outlived its import is never reported stale. That
//     arm walks the enumeration.
//   - The link name never appears as an importER, so an ungranted edge leading
//     OUT of the feature is not this rule's to see. Both walkers yield real
//     paths: a target outside the source root is not walked at all, and one
//     inside it is walked under whatever it classifies as — a link to
//     `alpha/service` denies as `innerlink` and imports as `alpha`.
//
// Two links to one target are two features here, and on a case-insensitive
// filesystem so are two casings of one link: `realpathSync` collapses spellings
// onto an enumerated directory, and there is none to collapse onto. Both
// addresses reach the same physical file, so one grant clears both.
//
// Two importees this rule stays silent about, both because the finding would be
// unclearable. A loose FILE at the features root classifies as a feature named
// `orphan-module.ts`, and no `orphan-module.ts/visibility.json` can exist —
// `placement/topology` reports the file itself, which is the half that can be
// acted on. A link to a file outside the root is the same unaddressable name
// with nobody holding the other half: the tier's walk drops anything reached
// through a symlink, so the walkers never see it and topology does not report it
// either. That one is silence, not coverage.
//
// A grant naming a link is a grant naming nothing, in both directions and for a
// different reason than any of the above: an importER name comes from walking
// the tree, and the walk yields the directory. No edge can ever carry the link
// spelling, so the stale-grant arm is right to say the name is not a feature
// even where the deny arm now treats it as one.

/**
 * Maps a classified feature name onto the feature it actually IS, or undefined
 * when it is not a feature at all.
 *
 * The classification names features by path text, and the same directory has
 * more than one spelling: a symlink beside it, or any casing of it on a
 * case-insensitive filesystem. Resolving each name and matching on the real path
 * is what makes those one identity — the identity the module resolver already
 * uses, which is the only one that governs the same tree the imports do.
 *
 * A name resolving to a DIRECTORY is a feature even when no enumerated one is
 * it. Usually that means a link out of the features root — vendored code, a
 * hoisted monorepo package — and always it means the resolver loading real code
 * under a name the listing does not contain, so answering "not a feature" there
 * is deny-by-default with a hole in it. It is its own feature, under the LINK name: that is the one spelling whose
 * `visibility.json` an author can create, and a finding nobody can clear is
 * worth no more than the silence it replaces. Where a project links features/
 * straight into `node_modules`, the grant the message asks for lands somewhere
 * an install overwrites — link a checked-in directory instead.
 *
 * Undefined is the two ways a name resolves to no feature, and both are about
 * that same clearability. A loose file at the features root classifies as a
 * feature (`features/orphan-module.ts` becomes a feature named
 * `orphan-module.ts`) and denying an import of it would file against
 * `orphan-module.ts/visibility.json`, a path nobody can create —
 * `placement/topology` reports the file itself, which is the half that can be
 * acted on. So the test is the directory, not "does it leave the root": a link
 * to a file outside it is still an unaddressable name. Nobody reports THAT one,
 * as the walkers do not list symlinked files either, and the header says so
 * rather than leaving it to read as covered. And a name resolving to nothing at
 * all is an import that does not load; whatever is wrong with it, it is not a
 * visibility question.
