// ─── placement/layer-direction ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Inside one feature, an import only goes down the layer stack, and
// no file in the feature imports the feature's own barrel. You can move a low
// layer to a new feature, or replace it, and read only the layers below it. When
// you change a high layer, no layer below it can break, because no layer below
// it imports it.
//
// Direction is the only question here. A downward edge that skips a layer is
// boundary/layer-occupancy's finding. The two are independent: an edge can be
// wrong under one, both, or neither, and one check that answers both is a check
// nobody can predict.
//
// Do not match "../service/" in a specifier. The same edge from a directory one
// level deeper ("../../service/x"), or as an alias to the same feature, looks
// correct to a pattern. The aliased spelling is what auto-import writes, thus it
// is the most frequent spelling of an upward edge.
//
// Type imports count. A type that goes up inverts the dependency as a value
// does, and you still cannot read the low layer without the high layer.
//
// The barrel arm is here and not in boundary/import-policy. That engine calls
// the edge internal, because both ends are one unit, which is correct for a
// question about imports between units and wrong for direction inside a feature.
