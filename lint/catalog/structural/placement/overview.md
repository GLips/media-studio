# placement — Where code may live

`placement/` is about the address a file has; [`boundary/`](../boundary/overview.md) is about what
it may import from there.

The whole-tree half. `topology` is the completeness check: every other rule in the catalog governs
paths it recognises, this one governs the paths nothing recognises. `layer-direction` reads the
resolved graph, so it sees an upward edge at any nesting depth and in either spelling. The per-file
half is in [../../oxlint/placement/overview.md](../../oxlint/placement/overview.md).

| Rule | Blocking | What it buys |
|---|---|---|
| [topology](topology.ts) | Yes | Each source file under a declared tree is at a path that a rule in this catalog matches |
| [layer-direction](layer-direction.ts) | Yes | Inside one feature, an import only goes down the layer stack, and no file imports the feature's own barrel |

`topology` says a file is at a permitted path. It never says the imports in that file are permitted.
`layer-direction` and the `boundary/` rules keep those subjects.

Before you take `topology`, compare what the tree's `sourceRootModules()` and `featureRootModules()`
return with the directory model the project chose. A file that the project's own model recommends,
and this rule rejects, makes a person turn the whole check off on the first commit. Both are derived
from the tree's vocabulary rather than listed beside this check, because the import policy reads the
same names — two lists meant a file this check permitted and the policy called an unpoliced area.

What you may change is the SPELLING of a position, in `sourceRootPositions` and
`featureRootPositions`. You cannot add one: those records are keyed by `SOURCE_ROOT_ROLES` and
`FEATURE_ROOT_ROLES`, closed sets in `policy/layout.ts`. Appending a name was how this check got
switched off silently — one entry, `helpers`, and both of its real findings went away.

`layer-direction` does not report a downward import that skips a layer. `boundary/layer-occupancy`
asks that question, from the same layer order — which is the ORDER of the shared layer roles, so the
two cannot disagree about which layer outranks which. `layer-direction` has no exclusion list,
and its severity is not configurable, so a codebase that adopts it must correct the upward edges it
already has. Its coverage is the coverage of `graph/import-graph`: an import form the graph does not
reveal is an edge this rule never receives.

Adoption mechanics, the spec contract, and what part of the tree owns each rule's subject: [../../overview.md](../../overview.md).
