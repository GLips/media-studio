// Makes sure: Each source file under a declared tree's root is at a path that a
// rule in this catalog matches. You can add a file and know that the layer
// rules read it. You do not have to look for the files that no pattern reaches
// before you trust a clean report.
//
// The check walks the whole source tree. Its subject is the absence of a match.
// A smaller scope leaves the paths outside it with no check at all, which is
// the exact condition this rule removes.
//
// The permitted names are a closed set, not a list of bad names. A list of bad
// names holds only the paths that a person thought of, and the next bad path is
// not on it.
//
// Do not test the first path segment alone. src/features/scanner/helpers.ts has
// the first segment `features` and passes that test. It is inside a feature but
// outside every layer, and it is the file this rule exists to find.
//
// Each message names a destination, not a refusal. This rule fires when a person
// has no obvious place for a file, and a refusal leaves that person at the same
// point. That person then turns the check off.
//
// A path this rule permits says nothing about the imports in the file or the
// kind of code in it. Those are the findings of placement/layer-direction and
// of the boundary/ rules.

/**
 * The path grammar inside ONE subdivided directory. It is per-directory because
 * `features/` and `domains/` are genuinely different shapes, and the difference
 * is not stylistic — it follows from what the other rules key on.
 *
 * Feature-scoped rules key on `features/<name>/<layer>/`, so a directory inside
 * a feature that is not a layer is reached by nothing and has to be rejected.
 * Domain-scoped rules key on `domains/<name>/` and reach the entire subtree, so
 * a module at a domain root is fully governed and there is nothing for a path to
 * escape into. Applying the feature grammar to domains rejects the layout
 * `directory-model.md` recommends — internal modules at the domain root — which
 * is this rule's own named failure mode.
 *
 * DERIVED from the tree's vocabulary rather than configured. A map an adopting
 * project fills in can be missing an entry, and this check would then pass
 * everything under that directory — a hole needing its own finding to report.
 * Deriving leaves no hole to report: the two subdivided directories are the two
 * the vocabulary names, and each has exactly one grammar.
