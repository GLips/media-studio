// ─── The tier's type checker ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One TypeScript process for the whole run, and one `Project` per declared tree.
// Every check that asks a question about a TYPE rather than about a path or a
// specifier reads its answers through here.
//
// Four files in this tier answer a question about code and none of them is a
// check — `import-scanning.ts`, `module-resolution.ts`, `import-graph.ts` and
// this one. The split between them is the
// same one that puts a rule in a tier at all: the graph answers where a
// specifier LANDS, and this answers what a declaration MEANS.
// Neither can answer the other's question, and a check reaching for the wrong
// one gets a confident wrong answer rather than an error.
//
// ── Why the sync client ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// TypeScript 7 ships two clients for the same server, and this takes the
// SYNCHRONOUS one. Both spawn the same child process and answer the same
// questions; what differs is the cost of asking, and asking is what this file
// does thousands of times. Over the same ~1,025 requests the async client spends
// ~145ms getting them across the pipe and the sync one ~70ms. Boot is a wash:
// the snapshot is ~50ms either way.
//
// The sync client reads `child.stdout._handle.fd` in its channel constructor, so
// it needs a runtime that exposes that Node internal, and it throws by name when
// it cannot get one. `lint/with-real-node.sh` is what guarantees such a runtime,
// and it is not optional for this tier for other reasons too — see its header.
//
// Nothing in this tier awaits anything as a result: a `StructuralCheck` returns
// its findings rather than a promise for them, and `check-context.ts` says what
// the compiler holds for it once that is true.
//
// ── Why `unstable` in the import path is an accepted cost ─────────────
//
// It is the only door. TypeScript 7's main entry exports `version` and
// `versionMajorMinor`; `ts.createProgram` is gone. A project on TypeScript 5
// would need the classic in-process API, which is a SECOND implementation of one
// question — the defect this catalog most reliably produces. So the tier takes
// the TypeScript 7 generation and says so, rather than carrying both.
//
// The bet is mostly already placed elsewhere: the shipped `.oxlintrc.json` turns
// on `typeAware`, which needs `oxlint-tsgolint`, which IS TypeScript 7's checker.
// What is new here is the version floor on the `typescript` package itself.
//
// ── Cost, measured rather than assumed ────────────────────────────────
//
// Requests dominate, not type checking. Over this repo's fixture tree — 380
// files in the program — the seven `types/` checks issue ~1,025 requests for
// ~80ms of server-side work, behind a ~50ms snapshot. So the two things worth
// doing are asking in BATCHES (`getTypeAtLocation` takes an array) and asking
// once per distinct TYPE rather than once per node. `typeFacts` below is the
// second: it turns ~1,130 requests into ~1,025 here, and saves more the larger
// the tree, because the memo is on the TYPE and one bag shape written in a
// thousand files is one type id.
//
// ── Negative space ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// - Nothing here observes the filesystem, and there is deliberately no
//   invalidation API. A host lives for ONE run over one snapshot, and
//   `disposeTypeCheckerHost()` ends it; a watch loop takes a fresh host. An
//   invalidation call no run makes is a call nothing proves, and the failure mode
//   it has is the quiet one — the wrong request shape is accepted, invalidates
//   nothing, and every re-run answers from the stale program with better timings.
// - A tree whose `tsconfig` misses files the tree contains is not detected here
//   — `assertTreeIsTypeChecked` in `check-context.ts` owns that, because it is
//   a question about the AGREEMENT between two declarations rather than about
//   either one.
// - There is no `.js` story. The program is whatever the tsconfig says, and a
//   tree of JavaScript gets whatever `allowJs` gives it.
