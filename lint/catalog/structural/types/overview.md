# types — Type evidence, with a checker

The half of the `types` tag that asks what a declaration MEANS rather than how it is spelled. Every
check here calls the TypeScript compiler through [../type-checker.ts](../type-checker.ts), so
`Promise<unknown>`, an alias two files away and an interface carrying an index signature are the
same answer as the shape written out. The per-file half — the assertions, which are syntax and need
no checker — is in [../../oxlint/types/overview.md](../../oxlint/types/overview.md).

What the checker buys these seven is on the record: answering "open key domain" and "resolves to
something broad" from syntax alone takes hundreds of lines enumerating spellings, and misses the
ones nobody thought of. Each is one call in [type-shapes.ts](type-shapes.ts).

| Rule | Blocking | What it buys |
|---|---|---|
| [no-opaque-record](no-opaque-record.ts) | Yes | A misspelled key is a compile error and not `undefined` at run time, in every spelling of the open dictionary |
| [no-widen-then-assert](no-widen-then-assert.ts) | Yes | A known type survives to the end of the function, so a field rename still reports at each use |
| [no-known-value-widening](no-known-value-widening.ts) | Yes | A literal keeps its own keys: `handlers.stpo` is an error and the editor lists the keys |
| [no-broad-parameters](no-broad-parameters.ts) | Yes | A body reads a parameter with no guard and no cast, and a wrong argument fails at the call site |
| [no-unknown-returns](no-unknown-returns.ts) | Yes | A caller reads a field off the result with no narrowing of its own |
| [no-unknown-type-aliases](no-unknown-type-aliases.ts) | Yes | A name in a signature states a contract; no alias chain ends at `unknown` |
| [no-runtime-typeof](no-runtime-typeof.ts) | Yes | Each representation check over an untyped value sits in one named guard or one schema |

## Declaring where the checker looks

Each declared tree names the `tsconfig` whose program contains it. That is a path, not compiler
options — the project already has a tsconfig, and a second set of options in a lint config is a
second answer to what the code compiles as.

"Whose program contains it" is the adaptation to get right. In a solution-style repo the tree's own
`tsconfig.json` is a `files: []` plus `references` root: a valid config whose program compiles
nothing, because TypeScript does not follow the references into it. Declaring it is refused with
its own message, because the fix is not widening that file — it is naming the referenced config
that actually holds the tree's files, `tsconfig.app.json` rather than the root that points at it.

A tree whose tsconfig does not compile every `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts` file in it — minus the tests,
scripts, generated and ambient files every check already exempts — fails the run with the missing
paths named, or, when the program holds none of them, with the config to declare instead. It is not a warning, because the alternative is worse: a check whose program holds none of
the tree's files reports nothing, and nothing is what a clean tree reports too.

## The open-dictionary trio

Three checks key on the same type from three directions: `Record<string, unknown>`, and its
index-signature and mapped-type spellings. [type-shapes.ts](type-shapes.ts) owns the answer, so they
cannot drift apart. Three private copies is the shape this defect takes here, and it hides well:
each check stays green while going silent on a spelling its sibling reports, so the disagreement
shows up as a bypass rather than as a failure.

- **[no-opaque-record](no-opaque-record.ts)** bans the type at the declaration.
- **[no-widen-then-assert](no-widen-then-assert.ts)** catches a known value routed through one and
  asserted back.
- **[no-known-value-widening](no-known-value-widening.ts)** catches an annotation deleting a
  literal's keys.

The question has two halves. Is the key domain open, and is the value opaque. The first two ask
both. `no-known-value-widening` asks only the first. That is why `Record<string, Handler>` reports
there and is legal in the other two: what it watches is the keys, whatever the value type says.
That row is a fixture in all three expectation files. It is the only place the three are meant to
disagree.

**A key domain is open exactly when the type has an index signature.** That is not a heuristic and
not a list — it is what TypeScript's own model means by an open domain. `Record<string, T>`,
`{ [k: string]: T }` and `{ [K in string]: T }` produce one; `Record<'draft' | 'paid', T>`,
`{ [K in keyof Config]: T }`, an enum key and `(typeof KEYS)[number]` produce properties instead.
Nothing here enumerates spellings, so there is no spelling to have missed.

**Three answers a syntactic walk cannot give, and these seven do.** Each is the checker earning the
tier line:

- A key domain named rather than spelled out — an imported alias, an imported enum, a conditional
  type, `Row['id']`, a `const` declared inside a function — resolves to what it actually is, so a
  domain that is finite in fact stays silent.
- `Partial<Record<string, unknown>>`, `Readonly<Record<…>>` and an interface carrying an index
  signature are open dictionaries whatever wraps them, and all three report as widening targets.
- An alias chain, an alias declared inside a function or a namespace, and an alias to a name from a
  dependency all resolve, so `no-unknown-type-aliases` sees past the top level of the file it is
  handed.

**Negative space.** What is still uncovered, and deliberately:

- A closed key domain with opaque values is covered by nothing. `Record<'draft' | 'paid', unknown>`
  and `{ [K in keyof T]: unknown }` are silent in all three. A misspelled key is already a compile
  error there. The reads still need casts, and no check in this catalog says so.
- An ARRAY is not a bag. `unknown[]`, `Array<unknown>` and `ReadonlyArray<unknown>` all carry a
  number index signature, and an open numeric domain is what an array is — the trio is silent on all
  three spellings, in a way that does not depend on which one was written. The broadness of the
  ELEMENT is a signature question and reports at the parameter or return type that names it.
- An UNINSTANTIATED generic mapped type is invisible. `type Bag<K extends string> = { [P in K]: V }`
  has no index signature until `K` is bound, so the alias itself is silent and each instantiation is
  judged on its own.
- Nothing here reads `node_modules`. An alias to a broad type from a dependency reports at the local
  alias and never at the dependency.

## No per-line escape, and one list that is a coverage list

This tier has no `eslint-disable`, and none is planned. Every finding in every walked file is
reported, so the recoveries these checks name in their messages — parse at the boundary, name the
type, write the guard — are the only ones there are. A disable comment quiets an oxlint rule and does
nothing to a check in this tier, so a project that expects to silence a type complaint one line at a
time gets no such line here.

The one thing an adopter genuinely edits here is `TRANSPARENT_CONTAINER_NAMES` in
[type-shapes.ts](type-shapes.ts), which is what a signature is read THROUGH: `Promise<unknown>`
answers as `unknown` because `Promise` is in it. Adding a project's own `Result<T, E>` is the
adaptation it exists for. Removing one of the four shipped names is not — it makes
`ReadonlyArray<unknown>` a contract again, which is an off-switch wearing a list. `bp-spellings.ts`
pins all four, so the deletion fails the suite instead of going quiet.

## `no-runtime-typeof` asks about the operand, not about `typeof`

Without a checker the only statable rule is a ban on every runtime `typeof` outside a type guard —
a tooling limit, not a position. Such a ban reports correct code: the SSR guard, and the
discrimination of a union the compiler has already narrowed.

Here a `typeof` reports when the operand is `unknown`, `any` or `object`; over a type, it is
ordinary control flow and is silent. Two silences follow, both deliberate:
`typeof window === "undefined"` does not report, and neither does `typeof value === "string"` over
`string | number`. A project that wants the total ban does not get it by configuring this check. It
gets it by not writing `typeof`.

The type-guard exemption stays, because it is what makes the check actionable: the fix for a
reported `typeof` is to move it into a function returning `value is T`.
[type-shapes.ts](type-shapes.ts) owns what a guard is and `no-broad-parameters` reads the same
answer to exempt the value that guard vouches for, so one check cannot demand the signature the
other reports.

Adoption mechanics, the spec contract, and what part of the tree owns each check's subject:
[../../overview.md](../../overview.md).
