// ─── types/no-runtime-typeof ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: No branch decides what an UNTYPED value is from its representation
// in memory. A `typeof` test over `unknown`, `any` or `object` is a parser
// written inline, so when the shape of that input changes you edit one branch in
// one file and every other reader of the same payload keeps its old assumption.
// Put the test in a named guard or a schema, and every caller narrows through it.
//
// ── Scoped to the UNTYPED operand ────────────────────────────────────
//
// A tier with no type information cannot ask whether the operand is `unknown` or
// `string | number`, so the only rule it can state is a ban on EVERY runtime
// `typeof` outside a type guard — a tooling limit rather than a position, and one
// that reports correct code: the SSR guard, and the discrimination of a union the
// compiler has already narrowed. A check written that way owes its adopters a
// warning to expect per-line disables.
//
// This check has a checker, so it states the position instead: a `typeof` is a
// violation when the operand HAS no type, and ordinary control flow when it has
// one.
//
// Two silences follow, and both are deliberate:
//   - `typeof window === "undefined"` does not report. `window` is
//     `Window & typeof globalThis`, which is a type; the guard is asking about
//     existence, not shape.
//   - `typeof value === "string"` over `string | number` does not report. That is
//     the compiler's own narrowing mechanism, and a check that reports it is
//     reporting correct code.
//
// A project that wants the total ban does not get it by configuring this check —
// there is no knob and there was never going to be one. It gets it by not
// writing `typeof`.
//
// The type-guard exemption stays, and it is what makes the check actionable: the
// fix for a reported `typeof` is to move it into a function that returns
// `value is T`, at which point the same test is the parse step rather than a
// branch. `typePredicateSubjects` in `type-shapes.ts` owns what a guard is, and
// `types/no-broad-parameters` reads the same answer to exempt the value that
// guard vouches for — so one check cannot demand the signature the other reports.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE:
//   - `typeof` over a GENERIC parameter is silent. `T` is a type parameter, not
//     `unknown`, even where every call site instantiates it broadly.
//   - The type-level `typeof X` in a type position is a different operator and is
//     never a subject.
//   - Nothing here reads WHAT the test compares against, so `typeof v ===
//     "sting"` is a typo this check does not catch. `typescript/no-unnecessary-
//     condition` is the near neighbour and is deliberately off; see the `types`
//     section of the shipped `oxlintrc.json`.
//
// SCOPE: this is a TREE-SCOPED check. It walks the declared trees and the
// type-carrying files inside them, minus what `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath`
// names — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither silence is
// coverage. It is also silent on any file its tree's tsconfig does not compile,
// which `assertTreeIsTypeChecked` turns into a loud failure rather than a quiet
// zero.
