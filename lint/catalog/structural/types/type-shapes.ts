// ─── Shared reading for the `types/` checks ───────────────────────────
//
// Everything the seven type-aware checks ask that more than one of them asks.
// Two questions carry the file — "is this key domain open" and "does this
// resolve to something broad" — and each is one call to the checker, which is
// the whole reason these checks live in this tier. `structural/types/overview.md`
// has the comparison against answering them from syntax alone.
//
// ── The one finding this file is built on ─────────────────────────────
//
// TypeScript gives a type an INDEX SIGNATURE exactly when its key domain is
// open, and PROPERTIES when it is closed. Every spelling lands on the right side
// of that line without being enumerated:
//
//   Record<string, unknown>              → 1 index info
//   { [k: string]: unknown }             → 1 index info
//   { [K in string]: unknown }           → 1 index info
//   Record<PropertyKey, unknown>         → 3 index infos (string, number, symbol)
//   Record<`user_${string}`, unknown>    → 1 index info
//   Partial<Record<string, unknown>>     → 1 index info
//   ---
//   Record<'draft' | 'paid', unknown>    → 0 index infos, 2 properties
//   Record<Status, unknown>   (an enum)  → 0 index infos, 2 properties
//   Record<(typeof KEYS)[number], …>     → 0 index infos, 2 properties
//   Record<keyof T, unknown>             → 0 index infos, 1 property
//
// Nothing above is enumerated anywhere in this file. The wrapped forms
// (`Partial<Record<…>>`, `Readonly<Record<…>>`) and the closed ones (an enum, a
// `keyof`, a `(typeof KEYS)[number]`) land on the right side without being named,
// which is why there is no spelling here to have missed.
//
// ── Negative space ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// - An UNINSTANTIATED GENERIC is invisible to the index-signature question.
//   `type Loosened<T> = { [K in keyof T as string]: unknown }` has no index info
//   until `T` is supplied, because the key domain is not resolved until then.
//   Each INSTANTIATION is judged on its own, and the alias is silent. It is
//   stated here rather than in one check's header because the predicate is
//   shared, so the blind spot is.
// - The ERROR type is never a subject. An unresolved name yields a type carrying
//   the `Any` flag, so a file mid-edit — or one importing a package that is not
//   installed — would otherwise report every broken annotation as a deliberately
//   broad one. `tsc` already has that complaint and states it better.
// - Nothing here reads a VALUE. Every question is about a declaration, which is
//   what keeps this tag disjoint from the shipped `no-unsafe-*` family: those
//   report an `any` value arriving somewhere typed, and these report a
//   declaration that names nothing. See the `types` section of the shipped
//   `oxlintrc.json` for why that gap is not a candidate for either side.
