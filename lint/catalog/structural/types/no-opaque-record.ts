// ─── types/no-opaque-record ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: No type is an open dictionary with an `unknown`, `any` or
// `object` value. That holds for `Record<string, unknown>`, an index signature,
// a mapped type with an open key domain, a union that collapses to `unknown`,
// and any alias to one of them. So a misspelled key is a compile error and not
// `undefined` at run time, and a field rename reports at each read.
//
// `any` sits beside `unknown` in the opaque-value set. A ban on `unknown` alone
// teaches an agent to write `any` on the retry, which is the weaker type.
//
// WHICH open key domain it is, is not read. `Record<number, unknown>`,
// `Record<PropertyKey, unknown>` and `Record<any, unknown>` hold the same values
// as the string-keyed one. Whether the domain is open AT ALL is the entire test,
// and it is not a test this check performs: TypeScript models an open key domain
// as an index signature and a closed one as properties, so `indexSignatures`
// returning anything IS openness. `type-shapes.ts` carries the table that
// establishes it. A closed domain names a shape — `{ [K in keyof T]: unknown }`
// is a dirty-field tracker, and so is `Record<keyof T, unknown>`.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE:
//   - `Record<'draft' | 'paid', unknown>` is silent. Its keys are closed, so a
//     misspelling is already a compile error — but its reads still need casts,
//     and NO rule in this catalog covers opaque values under a closed key domain.
//   - An ARRAY is not a bag, in any spelling. `unknown[]`, `Array<unknown>` and
//     `ReadonlyArray<unknown>` all carry a number index signature, and an open
//     numeric domain is what an array IS — "declare the fields" is not advice
//     about one. Its ELEMENT being broad is `types/no-broad-parameters`' and
//     `types/no-unknown-returns`' finding at the signature that names it.
//   - `Record<keyof T & string, unknown>` is silent: an intersection is closed
//     once any member is, and `keyof T` closes it. The price is that `keyof` of a
//     type that is ITSELF a bag stays silent.
//   - An UNINSTANTIATED GENERIC mapped type is silent — `type Loosened<T> = {
//     [K in keyof T as string]: unknown }` has no index signature until `T` is
//     supplied, so each instantiation is judged on its own. `type-shapes.ts`
//     states it once for every check that shares the predicate.
//   - A bag REACHED THROUGH a name this run WALKS reports at the declaration and
//     nowhere else. `type Bag = Record<string, unknown>; type Payload = Bag;` is
//     one finding, not two. A bag declared anywhere this run does not walk —
//     `node_modules`, a `.d.ts`, a test file, another declared tree — reports at
//     each USE instead, because the declaration is somewhere nothing will report.
//     "In the program" is deliberately NOT the test: it would make
//     `declare type Bag = Record<string, unknown>` in an ambient file silence the
//     check everywhere, which is an exemption an adopter grows by typing.
//   - The cross-tree case is therefore counted twice: a bag declared in one
//     declared tree and used in another reports at its declaration in the first
//     run and at each use in the second. Each finding is actionable where it
//     lands, and neither run can see the other's.
//
// A schema or serialization layer that needs the open bag takes the recovery the
// second bullet allows — a CLOSED key domain — or, where the keys are unknown
// until run time, names the value type. No directory silences this check, and the
// vocabulary names none for it.
//
// SCOPE: this is a TREE-SCOPED check. It walks the declared trees and the
// type-carrying files inside them, minus what `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath`
// names — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither silence is
// coverage. It is also silent on any file its tree's tsconfig does not compile,
// which `assertTreeIsTypeChecked` turns into a loud failure rather than a quiet
// zero.
