//
// Makes sure: A value with a known type keeps that type to the end of the
// function. No step assigns it to `unknown`, `object` or an open opaque `Record`
// and then asserts the type back with nothing checked between the two. So when
// you change a field on `User`, the compiler reports each use; the two steps
// cannot hold the old type in place.
//
// `types/require-safety-comment` does not cover this flow. It fires on the same
// line, and the compliant answer there is `// SAFETY: stored came from loaded,
// which is a User` — a true sentence that keeps both steps and silences the
// linter for good. Take the safety check alone and prose becomes the cheapest
// fix. The two are jointly actionable: deleting the widening clears both.
//
// Both steps must sit in the same function, and the assertion must come after
// the widening. Across a closure the two lines have different authors, and a
// check that called that flow pointless would be guessing.
//
// What counts as an open opaque dictionary is `type-shapes.ts`'s answer, so this
// cannot drift from `types/no-opaque-record` on which spellings are bags or on
// `object` as a value. `types/no-known-value-widening` reads only the KEY half of
// that answer, which is why `Record<string, Handler>` reports there and is silent
// here: a dictionary with a precise value type is evidence of a known type, not a
// widening.
//
// A CALL is evidence, because the checker reads its return type. `const user:
// unknown = loadUser()` where `loadUser` returns `User` is a widening and
// reports; `const parsed: unknown = JSON.parse(text)` is not, because `JSON.parse`
// returns `any` and there was no known type to lose. Which of the two a given
// call is, is a fact here rather than a guess from its name.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE:
//   - The widened binding must be a `const`. A `let` reassigned between the two
//     steps is not a flow this check can reason about: the value at the assertion
//     may not be the value that was widened.
//   - The asserted expression must be a plain identifier. `(f() as unknown) as
//     User` has no binding to follow and is `types/no-chained-type-assertions`'
//     subject.
//   - Widening through a PARAMETER is silent. `function f(x: unknown)` is
//     `types/no-broad-parameters`' finding, at the declaration, and reporting the
//     assertion too would prescribe an edit the caller has to make.
//
// SCOPE: this is a TREE-SCOPED check. It walks the declared trees and the
// type-carrying files inside them, minus what `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath`
// names — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither silence is
// coverage. It is also silent on any file its tree's tsconfig does not compile,
// which `assertTreeIsTypeChecked` turns into a loud failure rather than a quiet
// zero.
