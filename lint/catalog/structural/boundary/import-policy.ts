// ─── boundary/import-policy ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Every relative import gets the same verdict as its aliased form,
// and every import that leaves its unit uses the alias. To find each file that
// imports a feature, you search for one string — `@/features/<name>` in the
// default vocabulary. A rule that
// matches aliased paths applies to every edge, because a relative path cannot
// avoid it.
//
// Do not match the specifier text with a pattern. An import from
// features/alpha/ui/ to a sibling feature, "../../beta/x", holds no `features/`
// segment. That is the shortest form of an import out of a unit, and thus the
// most frequent one.
//
// Pass every relative edge, with no pre-filter — not even a filter that drops an
// edge whose two ends share a boundary. A tree's shared UI directory and the
// shared directory that contains it — `shared/ui/**` and `shared/**` in the
// default vocabulary — are one boundary and two units, and unit identity is what
// makes an edge `internal`. Such a filter does not see
// `import { theme } from "../lib/tokens"` in the shared UI directory.
//
// There is no exclusion list and no per-directory scope INSIDE a tree. A path
// that you exclude leaves the whole import policy, and no message says so. The
// one scope that exists is the declared tree itself: this runs once per tree,
// over that tree's graph, and an edge leaving the tree is not in that graph —
// cross-tree coupling is real and nothing in this tier reports it.
//
// Do not drop a type-only edge. The policy reads the type mark in one row only:
// a domain's runtime imports are narrower than its type imports. A forbidden
// direction stays forbidden for a type.
//
// Coverage equals the coverage of structural/import-graph.ts. For an edge form
// that does not arrive, extend the extractor there, and do not add a match here.
//
// An `internal` edge gets no report here. placement/layer-direction reports an
// edge that goes up, and boundary/layer-occupancy reports an edge that skips an
// occupied layer.
