// ─── boundary/layer-occupancy ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: A feature uses each layer it has. If the feature has a
// controllers directory, every call from ui goes through it. If it has a repo
// directory, all queries to its tables are in that directory. Thus you change
// a layer in one place, and the callers you find are all of the callers.
//
// Occupancy starts the check. To skip a layer that is not there is correct,
// thus this cannot be a static policy. The check tests for occupancy and not
// for a directory. An empty layer stops access to every layer below it and
// gives you no place to put the code.
//
// Do not match "../repo/" in a specifier. The same import from a directory one
// level deeper ("../../repo/x"), or as an alias to the same feature, looks
// correct to a pattern. A person who moves a layer into subfolders writes the
// deeper form.
//
// Type imports count. The result must not change for a type-only import; only
// the words in the message change. If the result changes, "import type"
// becomes the permitted spelling of the same problem.
//
// An import that goes up is placement/layer-direction's finding, not this one's.
