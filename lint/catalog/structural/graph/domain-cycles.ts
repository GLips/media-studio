// ─── graph/domain-cycles ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: No domain depends on a domain that depends on it back, at any
// depth, within one declared tree. You can move one domain into its own package, or delete it, and
// change only the code above it. You can test one domain with only the
// domains below it.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE: one declared tree's graph. `buildImportGraph` drops an edge
// whose other end resolves outside the tree it was built for, so a domain cycle
// that runs through a second declared tree appears in neither run. Nothing in
// this tier reports cross-tree coupling.
//
// The check reads the two resolved ends of each edge, never the specifier.
// Do not give it the alias prefix, and do not let it assume that
// boundary/import-policy removes the relative form first. People also write
// these imports relatively, and a missing edge makes no finding, thus the
// check reports clean.
//
// Type-only edges count. The graph marks them and this check ignores the
// mark. With a circular type dependency you must still change both domains
// at the same time.
//
// The check says nothing about which edges are correct. A layered domain
// graph, such as pricing -> catalog, is normal and gets no finding. A check
// that reports layered domains is one that people disable.
//
// Coverage is the graph's coverage. If this check does not see an import,
// change the extractor in import-graph.ts. A specifier match here gives two
// checks two different sets of imports under one stated scope.

 * Every strongly connected component with more than one member — which is

 *
 * Tarjan's rather than a three-colour DFS, though a domain graph runs well under
 * 20 nodes and either would be fast enough. The reason is the reporting shape:
 * a colour walk finds a back-edge and reports THE CYCLE IT IS STANDING IN, so a
 * component holding several intertwined cycles yields one finding per run and
 * the next one only appears after the first is fixed. An SCC pass surfaces every
 * independent cycle at once, and folds the intertwined ones into a single
 * component — which is also the honest unit, since they are untangled together.
