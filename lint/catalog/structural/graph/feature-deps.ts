// ─── graph/feature-deps ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: No feature imports a feature that imports it back, at any depth,
// within one declared tree.
// You can delete one feature, or move it into its own package, and change only
// the code that imports it. You do not have to edit two features together to
// make one change.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE: one declared tree's graph, and cycles that leave it are not in
// it. `buildImportGraph` drops an edge whose other end resolves outside the tree,
// so a cycle running through a second declared tree is invisible to both runs —
// a clean report here is a claim about one tree, not about the repo.
//
// The check reads the two resolved ends of each edge, never the specifier text.
// Do not match "@/features/<name>". People also write these imports as relative
// paths, and the check then does not see a cycle that it exists to find.
//
// Type-only edges count. A type that crosses a feature boundary makes the two
// features dependent: the importee cannot change the type unless the importer
// changes too.
//
// No entry in visibility.json makes a cycle legal, so do not add a way to grant
// one. The fix for a cycle is to move the shared code to domains/ or shared/.
//
// Cycles fail the run. The three coupling thresholds give warnings only, because
// the correct number changes with the size of the project. Do not make them
// errors before you set each one above the current count. A check that reports
// the project in its current state is a check the team disables. The cycle
// errors then stop with it.
//
// This check has no mode that only prints the edge set. A check returns findings
// and the orchestrator owns every mode; add a baseline report there, over the
// same graph.
