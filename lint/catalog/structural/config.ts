// ─── The structural tier's configuration ───────────────────────
//
// Every knob the script checks read lives here, in ONE object per project.
// Adopting this tier in a new codebase means writing an `arch.config.ts` that
// spreads the defaults below and overrides what differs — never editing a
// constant inside a check body.
//
// That constraint is the reason this file exists. The three deployments that
// hand-rolled these checks from prose each buried their roots and thresholds in
// the check that used them, so `check-layer-occupancy.ts` hardcoded
// `src/features` while its own documentation promised a configurable root, and
// nobody could tell by reading either one. A knob in a shared object is a knob
// a reader can enumerate; a knob in a function body is a fact about one repo.
//
// ── What is NOT here ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Where the trees are and what their directories are called. That is
// `lint/policy/declared-trees.ts`, which both tiers read, and it is deliberately
// not reachable from this object: a config field naming a source root or a layer
// is a second answer to a question the oxlint tier answers from the policy
// module, and the two tiers then police two different trees while both report
// clean. That was the state this file was in, and the config could express it.
//
// What remains here is what has no bearing on WHERE the architecture is: the
// project root every relative path resolves against, and per-check thresholds,
// manifests, trace limits and package names. Every one of those is a number or a name that
// says nothing about the shape of the tree.
//
// And every one of them is a number or a NAME. No field here is a regex, a glob,
// or a list of EXEMPTIONS an adopter grows. Lists of subject names are fine and
// several exist — `serverOnlyPackages`, the boundary's `calls`, the file-size
// roots — because each widens what a check looks at rather than narrowing what it
// may say. A predicate is a rule's own claim, and handed over
// as configuration it becomes an off-switch that leaves the check listed as
// enabled — `behaviorKeywords: /.*/` took `health/trampolines` from four
// findings to zero in this repo's own fixtures. Where a check needed a
// predicate, it now holds one; where it needed an exemption, it reads a
// structural fact. A check with nothing left to configure has no entry at all.
//
// ── Adapt ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Write this beside the checks and pass it to `runStructuralChecks`:
//
//   // lint/structural/arch.config.ts
//   import { resolve } from "node:path";
//   import { radius, spacing } from "../../src/shared/ui/theme.ts";
//   import { type ArchitectureConfig, defaultCheckConfigs } from "./config.ts";
//
//   export const architectureConfig: ArchitectureConfig = {
//     projectRoot: resolve(import.meta.dirname, "../.."),
//     checks: {
//       ...defaultCheckConfigs,
//       "style/token-equality": {
//         ...defaultCheckConfigs["style/token-equality"],
//         spacingScale: spacing,
//         radiusScale: radius,
//       },
//     },
//   };
//
// Spreads rather than a deep merge, deliberately: an override is then visible in
// the diff as the whole value it replaces, and there is no merge semantics to
// learn before you can predict what a config does.
//
