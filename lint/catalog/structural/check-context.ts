// ─── What a structural check is handed, and how it collects files ─────
//
// Answers nothing about code — `import-scanning.ts`, `module-resolution.ts`,
// `import-graph.ts` and `type-checker.ts` do that. This is the shape a check
// RECEIVES and the file collectors it walks a tree with, and every check in the
// tier takes both from here.
//
// Five things put a check in this tier rather than in `oxlint/<tag>/*.ts` as an
// oxlint rule:
//
//   1. counting across a file set   — file size, hooks per component, props
//   2. resolution across the tree   — where an import LANDS, not how it is spelled
//   3. a surface the linter cannot see — `.css`, `visibility.json`
//   4. reading the project's own source of truth — the token scale
//   5. asking what a declaration MEANS — a type, not a token (`type-checker.ts`)
//
// Everything here is what more than one such check needs. A check reaching for
// its own file walker or its own exclusion list is how two checks end up
// governing different sets of files while claiming the same scope.
//

 * compiled — and NOTHING makes them agree. A tsconfig that `exclude`s the tree,
 * an `include` narrowed to `src/app`, a monorepo root config that reaches only
 * as far as `apps/`: each of them leaves the types checks walking a program with
 * none of the governed files in it, reporting zero findings on every one. That
 * result is byte-identical to a tree with no violations, which is the failure
 * this catalog exists to prevent and the one it keeps committing.
 *
 * Measured over `collectTreeFiles`, so the exemptions are the catalog's own: a
 * tsconfig that excludes `*.test.ts` or the generated directories is the normal
 * case and is not a disagreement, because no check reads those files either.
 * Measured over `TYPESCRIPT_FILE_GLOB` rather than every source extension for
 * the reason given there: a `.js` file has no type syntax to check, and one
 * shadowed by a same-named `.ts` can never be in the program at all.
 *
 * The direction is one-way on purpose. A program REACHING past the tree is
 * fine — a tsconfig at the repo root legitimately compiles four packages — and
 * failing on it would make the correct monorepo config unusable.
 *
 * The failure has TWO shapes, and they get different messages because they have
 * different fixes. A program missing SOME of the tree is a narrow `include` or
 * a hungry `exclude`, and widening the config is the repair. A program holding
 * NONE of the tree is usually the wrong program: the natural thing to declare
 * for a tree is its `tsconfig.json`, and in a solution-style repo that file is
 * a `files: []` plus `references` root — a valid tsconfig that compiles nothing
 * itself. "Widen the include" is precisely the wrong advice there; the fix is
 * to name the referenced config that actually holds the tree's files, and the
