// ─── What a file imports, and what it offers ──────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure of nothing on its own. Two questions about one file's import and
// export statements, one parser, and this is the tier's ONE answer to each:
//
//   `scanDeclaredImports` — which quoted paths does this file NAME. The text
//   inside the quotes is the specifier: `"./rows.ts"`, `"@/features/orders"`,
//   `"stripe"`. Consumed by `import-graph` (which resolves each one and compares
//   the two ends as paths) and by `api/barrel-purity` (which asks which packages
//   a barrel can reach at runtime).
//
//   `scanDeclaredExports` — which names does this file OFFER, and where each one
//   comes from. Consumed by `naming/barrel-discoverability`, whose subject is
//   whether a public name is greppable; it never resolves a specifier and asks
//   nothing about where one lands.
//
// Do not let a consumer read either question for itself. Two answers to one of
// them disagree about which spellings count, and the disagreement is invisible,
// because the reader that misses a form reports nothing rather than failing.
//
// The two questions overlap on the STATEMENT and not on the subject: `export { a
// } from "./x"` is an occurrence of `./x` to the first and an offer of `a` to the
// second. Both readings come off one parsed export statement here, so no consumer
// can hold a third idea of what that line says.
//
// `module-resolution.ts` turns one of those quoted paths into the file it means,
// and `type-checker.ts` asks TypeScript what a declaration's type is. This file
// is upstream of both: nothing can be resolved before it is found.
//
// The parse is `oxc-parser`'s — the parser under the oxlint this catalog already
// ships, and the same project as the `oxc-resolver` beside it. It hands back a
// module record: the file's import and export statements, listed, each with its
// quoted path already unescaped. Everything below reads that. What it buys over
// a transpiler's import scan is that it does not ERASE and does not INJECT: a
// transpiler is asked what the emitted module needs, and the answer is missing
// every type-only import and carrying JSX-runtime imports the file never wrote.
// Recovering the first by rewriting the source and subtracting the second by
// counting `require(` literals is what this module replaced, and both were
// approximations that lost real forms — see TYPE-ONLY IMPORTS below.
//
// ── Every occurrence, in source order, with a real span (imports) ─────
//
// One entry per OCCURRENCE, not per specifier: a file importing `./a` twice gets
// two entries, because `boundary/import-policy` reports each crossing where it
// is written. `offset` is the span of the quoted path itself, which the
// parser knows exactly. Nothing here searches the text for a quoted path —
// a specifier written with a unicode escape has a cooked value matching no
// literal in the source, and prose quoting the same path can sit above the real
// import and claim its line.
//
// ── TYPE-ONLY IMPORTS ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `typeOnly` is per occurrence and it is the whole reason this is a parser. An
// import is type-only when it emits no runtime code, which the two consumers
// want in OPPOSITE directions: the graph keeps those edges, because a type
// import still couples two boundaries, and `api/barrel-purity` drops them,
// because a type import cannot put a server-only package in a client bundle.
//
// A scanner that erases them can only serve the second, and the first then has
// to rebuild what was thrown away. These are the five forms the rewrite-and-
// rescan pass could not rebuild, each one a valid import that reached NO check:
//
//   import /* why */ type { A } from "./a";   // a comment between the keywords
//   export type /* why */ { B } from "./b";
//   import { type A /* } */ } from "./a";     // a brace in a comment ends the braces
//   type C = import("./c").C;                 // an import in a type position
//   type D = typeof import("./d");
//
// The last two are not a rewriting problem at all — no spelling of `import type`
// appears in them — and no text pass was ever going to reach them.
//
// ── One entry per NAME (exports) ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Where the two questions part. An import occurrence is one written specifier,
// so `export { a, b } from "./x"` is ONE of those — two edges on one line would
// make every rule reading the graph report that line twice. It is TWO offers,
// because `a` and `b` are two symbols a reader greps for separately, and the
// offer carries the span of its own member so a list running down a screen
// reports each name where it is written.
//
// `typeOnly` is per name for the same reason, and it is not the import side's
// all-or-nothing mark: in `export { type A, b } from "./x"`, `A` is erased and
// `b` is not, and a consumer asking about `A` is asking about `A`.
//
// ── NEGATIVE SPACE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// WHAT A WILDCARD OFFERS IS NOT HERE. `export * from "./x"` is reported as a
// wildcard and never expanded: the names it forwards are declared in another
// file, and enumerating them means resolving the specifier and reading what is
// there — `module-resolution.ts`'s question, and then a whole chain of them. A
// consumer that needs the expanded surface walks the graph itself. Nothing here
// can tell you whether a wildcard offers one name or four hundred.
//
// CommonJS has no export statement and none is reconstructed. `module.exports = …`
// and `exports.a = …` put names on a surface, and neither is read: the import
// side reads `require` because a boundary crossing is its subject, and no check
// in the tier asks what a CommonJS module offers. A project whose public surface
// is spelled that way has no check reading it.
//
// A specifier that is not a static string is not reported and cannot be:
// `import(`./${name}`)` names a module only at runtime. This is the one import
// form the tier is blind to, and it is blind to it by construction rather than
// by omission.
//
// NOTHING ELSE IN THE CATALOG COVERS IT. No check reads a computed specifier, no
// check counts how many a module has, and no check reports a module for building
// one — so a boundary crossed through a computed specifier is crossed with every
// rule here silent, and the run is green. Do not read this paragraph as a
// hand-off: there is no second check downstream that catches what this cannot
// see. A project that routes real crossings through computed specifiers is a
// project this tier does not govern, and the only fix is to write the specifier
// statically.
//
// `require()`, `require.resolve()` and `import x = require()` are reported,
// because a project that still has CommonJS in it crosses boundaries with them,
// and an unreported crossing is a rule that silently does not apply to those
// files. `import.meta` is not an import and is not reported.
//
// PARSE ERRORS THROW, on both questions. A file whose clauses cannot be read is
// a file no boundary rule and no naming rule governs, and the tier has one job
// that outranks completing the run.
