// ─── graph/import-graph — the resolved import graph ───────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Every rule sees where an import lands, and not how a person
// writes it. The relative path "../../beta/service" and the alias
// "@/features/beta" give the same answer. A person cannot get past a boundary
// rule when they write a crossing as a relative path.
//
// Not a rule. Every graph-reading check consumes this and no check reads
// imports itself. Whether an import leaves its boundary depends on
// the depth of the file that holds it, never on the shape of the specifier, so
// each edge is resolved and compared as a path. Do not match a pattern against
// a specifier.
//
// This file holds POLICY and extracts nothing. Finding the quoted paths belongs
// to `import-scanning.ts` and following them to `module-resolution.ts`; what is
// here is the composition — classify both ends, keep the edge, place it on a
// line.
//
// api/barrel-purity is the one rule that reads imports and does not take the
// graph. Resolution discards bare package names, and those names are that
// rule's subject. It reads the same two modules one layer lower, scanning for
// itself and resolving for itself, rather than a second answer to either.
//

/**
 * Where one end of an edge sits, as far as any rule here asks.
 *
 * A union rather than a record of optional fields, because the mutual exclusions
 * are facts about the tree and belong in the type. A path is in a feature or in
 * a domain and never both; a layer is a position INSIDE a feature, so a domain
 * end and an `infrastructure` end have no layer to read. The union makes those
 * combinations unspellable — a domain end carrying a layer, a feature end with no
 * feature name — so a consumer reads `kind` and has the rest, with no runtime
 * guard recovering a shape the type could have stated.
 *
 * The boundary STRING is deliberately not here. For a feature or a domain it is
 * `<dirName>/<name>` and the consumer that wants it already holds both halves;
 * for anything else no rule asked. A consumer needing more about an end than
 * this says reads `edge.target`, which is the resolved path — see the note on
 * that field.
 *
 * Features are tested before domains, so a tree that gave `featuresDir` and
 * `domainsDir` the same spelling would classify every domain as a feature and
 * take every domain rule quiet. That vocabulary cannot be declared —
 * `assertGoverningVocabulary` refuses a name collision among the top-level
 * positions, for exactly this reason — so the order here is an implementation
 * detail rather than a hole.
