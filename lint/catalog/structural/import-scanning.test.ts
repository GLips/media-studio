// ─── The scanner's own cases ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `import-scanning.ts` makes no finding, so the fixture tree can only reach it
// through a check's VERDICT — and most of what this module promises does not
// change one. A line hard-coded to 1, an order that is not source order, a
// specifier form dropped from a file that has three others: every one of those
// leaves the whole structural suite green, because a verdict says which file is
// wrong and never where or how many times.
//
// So the properties here are asserted against the scanner directly. What stays
// in the tree is anything a check ANSWERS differently — a `require.resolve`
// crossing that must fire, a type-only re-export that must stay quiet — because
// there the verdict is the claim and asserting the mark instead would prove the
// scanner agrees with itself.
//
// This ships beside the module for the reason `policy/import-policy.test.ts`
// does: a project copying `structural/` gets the proof with the code. A spec
// that lives in the catalog's harness is a spec no adopter ever runs, and the
// module they copied is then unproved in the only repo it will run in.
//
// It imports `node:test`, which the neutrality contract in `overview.md` forbids
// the modules beside it: that contract governs what SHIPS into both runtimes,
// and a spec ships into neither.
