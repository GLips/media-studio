// ─── policy/import-policy — one table, one evaluator, two callers ────────────
//
// Tag:       boundary
// Mechanism: pure policy, read by both enforcement tiers
// Blocking:  Yes, in both
//
// Prevents:  Every import direction and every exposure decision in the layout
//            `directory-model.md` describes, declared once over an exhaustive
//            key instead of scattered across five rules that each carried a
//            slice of it. This table is the only statement of those decisions —
//            a doc that renders it as a grid is a second copy, and the copy is
//            what goes stale.
//
// Five rules held overlapping copies of this and the copies disagreed:
// `shared-purity` banned every `@/` import from `src/shared/*.ts` while
// `shared-ui-purity` allowed `@/shared/…` from `src/shared/ui/`, so
// `shared/ui → shared/theme` passed both — to the first the file IS shared, to
// the second the target is not a feature. Nobody owned the edge. Coverage with N
// rules is whatever the union of their path regexes happens to be, and the holes
// are INVISIBLE: `infrastructure → routes`, `service → infrastructure` and
// `route → domains` were each guarded by nothing and nothing said so. Declared
// over `SourceProfile × TargetArea` against a default of `deny`, an unguarded
// edge cannot exist: a cell nobody wrote is REFUSED rather than missing, and
// adding a profile or an area is a compile error before it can be either.
//
// ── Who reads this ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//   lint/oxlint/boundary/import-policy.ts       aliased specifiers and bare packages
//   lint/structural/boundary/import-policy.ts   resolved relative edges
//
// The split is inherent in the data, not a partition anyone maintains. A package
// has no relative spelling, so oxlint owns package policy completely; a relative
// path cannot be resolved by a linter at all, so the graph owns those. Both hand
// this module the SAME source-root-relative string, so the two spellings of one
// edge cannot reach different verdicts.
//
// That is also what makes coverage durable rather than inherited. An
// oxlint-only engine would depend on the alias-spelling check normalising every
// crossing before the engine saw it — one check guaranteeing another's
// completeness, with nothing verifying the link. Here, if alias reporting breaks,
// a forbidden relative edge still gets its semantic denial; only the spelling
// diagnostic is lost.
//
// ── What this table does NOT answer, and who does ─────────────────────────────
//
// A cell says whether the DIRECTION is open and through what surface. Four rules
// in the catalog narrow cells this table leaves at `any`, and each survives
// because its question is finer than an area:
//
//   boundary/client-server-infra  which infrastructure modules are client-safe.
//                                 Every `infrastructure: "any"` cell on a client
//                                 profile is narrowed by that allowlist.
//   boundary/db-isolation         which modules may name `infrastructure/db`.
//   api/server-import-context     which callers may name a unit's `index.server`
//                                 barrel — the `barrel` surface admits both
//                                 spellings, and that rule decides which of them
//                                 a given caller gets.
//   boundary/layer-occupancy      whether a permitted downward edge SKIPS a layer
//                                 that exists. That is a filesystem question.
//
// `any` therefore means "this policy permits the direction", never "nothing else
// checks it". Folding those four in was considered and refused: each is keyed by
// an exact module or by the filesystem rather than by an area, and reaching a
// shape where one table could express them forces cells that state something
// untrue so the machinery can work.
//
// ── Adapt ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Change a cell, not a rule. The row is the position a file occupies and the
// column is where its import lands; `ImportSurface` is what the cell grants, and it
// carries the exposure question with it so `deny` stays a DIRECTION message and a
// surface mismatch stays an EXPOSURE message without either being separate data.
//
// Layer direction is deliberately NOT here. `FEATURE_LAYER_ROLES` in `layout.ts`
// is the sole policy data — its ORDER is the ranking, reached through
// `orderedLayerDirs` — and `placement/layer-direction` compares two indices
// against it; writing the derived result out again would create exactly the drift
// this module removes and would need a warning telling readers not to "fix" it.

Connection and key material arrive from the layers above, which keeps every query runnable against any client — and a ${layers.repo}/ module that names another feature or a domain has stopped being data access and become a second ${layers.service}/.`;

    case "domain":
      return `${domains} holds business logic that is independent of delivery: same inputs, same answer, always. That is not housekeeping — a rule that reads env behaves differently between a local run and a shipped build, and a rule that queries behaves differently when the database is slow, so both make an answer depend on something other than the arguments. Neither looks like a failure, because the answer still arrives. Dependencies come in as parameters: the caller fetches, and the domain decides what the data MEANS.`;

    case "infrastructure":
      return `An adapter wraps one capability the outside world offers, and it faces DOWNWARD only. Reaching up into a feature, a domain or a route inverts the app: the wrapper stops being something a feature can be given and becomes something that knows what the app does with it, and neither can then be replaced on its own. It has no screen either, so the design system is not its to import.`;

    case "shared":
      return `Everything imports ${shared}, which is exactly why it may import nothing back: an edge out of here is reachable from any file in the app, so it is where cycles cost the most and show the least. The practical loss is portability — a helper that reaches into a feature stops being generic and becomes that feature's code filed in the wrong drawer. The fix is almost always to MOVE the module: if it needs a feature it belongs in that feature, if it needs an adapter it belongs in ${infrastructure}.`;

    case "shared-ui":
      return `The shared primitives in ${sharedUi} are the vocabulary every screen is written in, so anything they depend on becomes a dependency of the entire app's UI. A primitive that reads the server env, or knows what an invoice is, cannot be used on the screen that has neither — and the next screen that needs it writes a second one. It also keeps the layer honest about what it decides: a component here settles presentation, and the moment it also settles where data comes from it has taken a decision that belongs to the screen, for every screen at once.`;

    case "source-root":
      return `The files directly in the source root are the composition root: the env modules, the router, the client and server entrypoints. They wire the app together, which is why they may name almost anything below them — and why they may not name a feature or a domain. Wiring that knows which features exist is an app that cannot add one without editing its own boot sequence; the router reaches features through the route tree, which is generated. A feature's public surface is its ${barrel}, and ${routes} is what mounts it.`;

    "{{path}} sits inside a declared tree and matches no part of the architecture, so no import policy applies to it — nothing this file imports is checked, and nothing reports that. Either move it into an area that exists ({{areas}}) or, if this really is a new area, give it a SourceProfile in lint/policy/layout.ts and a row in lint/policy/import-policy.ts. Writing the row is the point: it names every area the new position may reach, and an area it leaves out is denied — so an empty row is a position that reaches nothing, and no row at all is a compile error.",

  unclassifiedTarget:
    '"{{specifier}}" resolves to {{target}}, which is in no known area. A directory inside a declared tree that no TargetArea claims is an unpoliced destination: every rule about what may import it is vacuous, in both directions. Add it to lint/policy/layout.ts, then give it a verdict in DEFAULT_SURFACE in lint/policy/import-policy.ts — that is the compile error you will get — and name it in the row of each profile allowed to reach it. Deciding it happens in those two places; an area a row does not name is denied, so there is no row to go and fill in with a denial.',

  deniedDirection:
    '{{profile}} may not import {{area}} — "{{specifier}}" lands in {{target}}. {{rationale}}',

    'A domain took a runtime dependency on {{area}} — "{{specifier}}". {{rationale}} A domain may runtime-import another domain, its own siblings and the shared tree, and nothing else; naming a TYPE from anywhere is free, because a type import is erased and cannot change what an answer depends on. A package is not exempt for being small: a schema library reaches no network, but a schema living in the domain is the domain deciding how a payload is PARSED, which is a boundary decision.',

  crossingSpelledRelatively:
    '"{{specifier}}" leaves {{fromUnit}} and lands in {{toUnit}}. Write it as "{{canonical}}" instead. The policy allows this edge; what it does not allow is hiding it — the relative spelling of a crossing is the form the specifier-matching tier cannot see, so a rule that governs the aliased path governs nothing here.
