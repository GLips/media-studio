# policy — the tables both tiers read

Runtime-neutral. The contract binds what SHIPS into both runtimes — a `<name>.test.ts` beside a table ships into neither and is outside it, which is why the spec here imports `node:test`. Every other module may import nothing but other modules here, and may reference:

- **no Node APIs** — no `node:fs`, no `node:path`, nothing that assumes a filesystem
- **no oxlint or ESTree types** — no `definePlugin`, no AST node types, no `Rule` context
- **no import from `../oxlint/` or `../structural/`** — the dependency runs the other way

What is left is data and pure functions over it: tables, vocabularies, and evaluators that take a
string and return a verdict.

## Why the constraint is worth the directory

Some architectural questions are asked from both tiers, and each tier sees a different half of the
evidence. Whether an import is legal is the standing example: the oxlint tier sees what one file
writes in its import quotes, aliased paths and bare package names, and the structural tier sees
resolved relative edges across the whole graph. If each tier carries its own copy of the answer, one
edge reaches two verdicts depending on how it happened to be spelled — and the disagreement is
invisible, because neither tier can see the other's table.

A rule whose question needs both tiers therefore has its *policy* here and an *adapter* on each
side. Both adapters hand the same evaluator the same source-root-relative string, so there is one
answer and one place to change it.

The neutrality is what makes that possible. A table that imports `node:path` cannot be read by a
rule running inside oxlint's plugin host; a table that imports an ESTree type cannot be read by the
script walking the filesystem. The moment either happens, the shared answer stops being shared
and the directory has bought nothing.

## What lives here

| Module | What it holds | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| [declared-trees.ts](declared-trees.ts) | The one list of trees this project adopted the catalog for, each a source root plus its vocabulary — and `classifyFileRole`, which resolves an absolute filename into the tree that governs it. **This is the whole adaptation surface: edit this file, never a rule.** | Every oxlint rule, `structural/check-context.ts` |
| [layout.ts](layout.ts) | What a tree's vocabulary can say — directory names, feature layers, barrel and env module names, asset extensions — and the classifiers that turn a source-root-relative path into a `SourceProfile` or a `TargetArea`, given a vocabulary | Both `import-policy` adapters, `boundary/sdk-containment`, `placement/layer-direction` |
| [import-policy.ts](import-policy.ts) | The `SourceProfile × TargetArea` table — a `deny` default plus each profile's deviations from it — the rationale each denial is rendered with, and `evaluateImportPolicy` | `oxlint/boundary/import-policy.ts`, `structural/boundary/import-policy.ts` |
| [package-owners.ts](package-owners.ts) | One row per contained package: which modules may import it, and why | `oxlint/boundary/sdk-containment.ts` |
| [import-policy.test.ts](import-policy.test.ts) | The engine's own specs — the materialised grid of all 130 resolved cells, that each path reaches the cell its author intended, and that one edge spelled two ways reaches one verdict | The rule harness, under Node |

**A cell nobody wrote is denied, not missing.** A row in the table declares only where its profile
deviates from `DEFAULT_SURFACE`, which is `deny` in all ten areas, and `importSurfaceFor` is the one
way to read a cell — the table itself is private, because a direct lookup returns `undefined` for
every undeclared cell and `undefined` is not a verdict. So `feature-barrel` is `{}`, which says
"reaches nothing" better than ten identical `deny`s did, and 59 declarations state what 130
written-out cells used to.

Both halves of the exhaustiveness survive, each in one place. Adding a `TargetArea` is a compile
error at `DEFAULT_SURFACE`, once instead of in twelve rows; adding a `SourceProfile` is a compile
error at the table, which must name every one. The same argument runs through the layer roles: a
tree may RENAME `service/` in its vocabulary, which is one string, but adding a layer means adding a
role to `FEATURE_LAYER_ROLES`, and the table then fails to compile until the new profiles have rows.

What the sparse table gives up is a row you can read whole, and `MATERIALISED_POLICY` in
`import-policy.test.ts` is that row for every profile — all 130 resolved cells, written by hand,
exhaustive by type the same way. It is the better artifact: a literal table can only assert itself,
and this one additionally proves that resolution produces the grid.

**A tree you did not declare is a tree you did not adopt for.** Every tree-scoped rule in both tiers
is silent outside every root in `declared-trees.ts` — no findings, no "unclassified" diagnostic —
and that silence is not coverage. The file's own header says it, and a project's setup notes have to
say it too, because an undeclared package reads exactly like a clean one.

Three checks are not tree-scoped and do run there: `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a
test file and which is therefore global, and the two project-scoped structural checks
`health/file-size` and `health/doc-budgets`, which walk their own configured roots. None of them
says anything about architecture, so the claim above holds for everything this directory owns.

## There is a second path classifier, and which one to reach for

`structural/import-graph.ts` classifies a path too, into a **boundary** — `features/alpha`,
`shared`, `infrastructure` — and that is not the same answer `layout.ts` gives. Both take a
source-root-relative path and split it on segments; they deliberately disagree about one thing, and
the disagreement is the point:

| | `import-graph.ts`'s `classify` | `layout.ts`'s `classifySourcePath` |
|---|---|---|
| Answers | boundary, feature, layer | profile and **unit** |
| `shared/ui/card.ts` | boundary `shared` | unit `shared/ui` |
| Reach for it when | the question is about the coarse grouping — cycles between features, coupling counts, which feature an edge belongs to | the question is what an edge is *permitted* to do |

`graph/domain-cycles` and `graph/feature-deps` want the coarse one: a cycle between two features is
a fact about the features, and subdividing `shared` would not change it. Anything the policy touches
wants the fine one, because `shared/ui` and `shared` being one boundary and two units is exactly the
edge a boundary comparison cannot see.

A new check picks by that question, not by which import is closer to hand. `placement/layer-direction`
uses both in one function and is the seam to read first if this ever needs changing.

The spec ships beside the tables for the same reason a rule's spec ships beside the rule — a project
copying `policy/` gets the proof that it still means what it meant here. It runs with the oxlint
tier (`npm run check:rules`): one spec run for a table both tiers read is a table proved once.
