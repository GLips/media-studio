// ─── policy/layout — what a tree is called, and where a file sits in one ─────
//
// The vocabulary both enforcement tiers share, as a VALUE rather than as a set
// of module constants. One `TreeVocabulary` describes one declared tree: how its
// directories are spelled, how deep its feature layers go, which files may sit
// at its root. `policy/declared-trees.ts` is the list of trees a project has
// adopted, and every classifier here takes the vocabulary of the tree the file
// was resolved into.
//
// It is deliberately BELOW both tiers: no runtime APIs, no oxlint ESTree types,
// no import from `../structural/` or `../oxlint/`. Plain strings, records,
// discriminated unions, pure functions.
//
// That constraint is a CONVENTION and NOTHING enforces it: both tooling
// tsconfigs include this directory under the same `types`, so the second
// program cannot catch what the first one lets through. A `node:` import, an
// oxlint type, a reach into `../oxlint/` — all compile clean and all are caught
// by review or by nothing. Make the rule mechanical the first time one lands in
// a diff, rather than asking this paragraph to hold it.
//
// Everything here speaks ONE currency: a path from a tree's source root, with no
// leading slash and no extension needed — `features/billing/repo/invoice-rows`.
// That is what makes the two callers interchangeable. The resolved import graph
// produces it by resolving a relative specifier and taking `relative(root, …)`;
// an alias specifier becomes the identical string by slicing the alias prefix.
// One classifier, one evaluator, two ways of obtaining its input.
//
// ── Adapt ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Renaming a top-level directory, renaming a feature layer, or moving a source
// root is a change to the tree's vocabulary in `declared-trees.ts` and nowhere
// else. The policy table in `import-policy.ts` is keyed by the ROLES below, so
// the spelling is free to move and the set of positions is not.
//
// ── What is vocabulary and what is not ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// A role is fixed; its spelling is vocabulary. `FEATURE_LAYER_ROLES` is the
// closed set of positions inside a feature and their ORDER, and it is shared by
// every tree because `import-policy.ts` has one row per position — adding a
// fifth layer is a compile error until that row is filled in, which is the
// property a bare `string[]` of layer names could not offer. Renaming `service/`
// to `usecases/` is a different act entirely: it moves one string in one tree's
// `featureLayerDirs` and every classifier, every rank comparison and every
// message follows.
//
// Do not collapse the two into a single ordered list of directory names. The
// ORDER is a shared fact about the architecture and the NAMES are a tree's own,
// so one list makes a rename look like a reordering: the structural tier follows
// the new names while the oxlint tier's profiles, which key on role, do not
// notice — and both tiers report clean about different trees.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
