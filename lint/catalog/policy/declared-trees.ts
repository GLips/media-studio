// ─── policy/declared-trees — which trees this project adopted the catalog for ─
//
// The one list. A declared tree is a source root plus the vocabulary that root
// uses, and BOTH tiers read this file: the oxlint rules resolve the file they
// were handed into a tree before they match anything, and the structural tier's
// `arch.config.ts` binds the same list to a project root.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE, and it has to be in the setup docs as well as here: a tree you
// did not declare is a tree you did not adopt for. Every TREE-SCOPED rule in this
// catalog is SILENT outside every declared tree — no findings, no warnings, no
// "unclassified" diagnostic. THREE checks are not tree-scoped and do still run
// there: `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and which is
// therefore enabled globally, and the project-scoped `health/file-size` and
// `health/doc-budgets`, which walk their own configured roots. That is the whole
// list, and it is not coverage. An undeclared package reads
// exactly like a clean one, so a repo that adds `packages/reporting/` and forgets
// this file has added an unpoliced tree and nothing will say so.
//
// ── Adapt ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One entry per tree the catalog governs. A single-app repo declares one:
//
//   export const DECLARED_TREES: ValidatedTrees = declareTrees([
//     { root: "src", vocabulary: RECOMMENDED_VOCABULARY, tsconfig: "tsconfig.json" },
//   ]);
//
// A monorepo declares one per governed source root, and each carries its OWN
// vocabulary — the app may layer features while a package spells its adapters
// differently:
//
//   export const DECLARED_TREES: ValidatedTrees = declareTrees([
//     { root: "apps/web/src", vocabulary: RECOMMENDED_VOCABULARY, tsconfig: "apps/web/tsconfig.json" },
//     {
//       root: "packages/core/src",
//       vocabulary: { ...RECOMMENDED_VOCABULARY, infrastructureDir: "db" },
//       tsconfig: "packages/core/tsconfig.json",
//     },
//   ]);
//
// `declareTrees` is not decoration: it validates each vocabulary and brands the
// list, and every consumer takes the branded type — so a declaration that skips
// it does not compile.
//
// The vocabulary is names and numbers only — see `TreeVocabulary`. What a tree
// cannot declare is which INVARIANTS apply to it: there is no per-tree rule list
// here, and adding one would turn this catalog back into a menu.
//
// Whatever this list says, the shipped `.oxlintrc.json` has to say too: its
// `overrides` entry scopes the `arch/` rules to these roots, and
// `harness/run-rule-fixtures.ts` fails the build when the two disagree.
// Declaration and scoping are one list wearing two hats, exactly as registration
// and enablement are.
