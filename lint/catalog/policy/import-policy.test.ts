// ─── The policy engine's own cases ────────────────────────────────────
//
// `lint/oxlint/boundary/import-policy.test.ts` proves the oxlint RULE, and the
// structural fixture tree proves the structural check. This proves the ENGINE
// both of them read, in three halves.
//
// The first is the MATERIALISED grid — all 130 resolved cells, written by hand.
// It is the one place a case per cell earns its keep, and the reason is that the
// source table no longer holds one: a row declares only where it deviates from
// `DEFAULT_SURFACE`, so what the evaluator reads is a resolution rather than a
// literal. Asserting a literal grid against that resolution is not
// `table === table` — a row deleted, a cell dropped, a default flipped from
// `deny` to `any` each change a value here, and none of them changes a lookup
// into itself. It is also the row a reader can read whole, which is the only
// thing the sparse table gave up.
//
// Generating one case per cell from the table the evaluator reads would be the
// tautology: it passes for any table, including a wrong one, and it goes red on
// every deliberate policy change while catching none of the bugs this module was
// built after. Every one of those was a CLASSIFICATION or MATCHING bug —
// `shared` and `shared-ui` disagreeing about a module, a rule banning a spelling
// rather than a dependency, a deep-import pattern needing a segment past the
// feature name so bare barrels escaped, regexes over-matching `ui-kit` and
// `features-legacy`. None was a lookup bug.
//
// So the second half, the generated coverage, sits on classification: real repo
// paths and real specifiers, each stating which profile, which area, and
// therefore WHICH CELL it reaches. The cell's contents are the grid's business;
// that a path arrives at the intended cell is that suite's.
//
// The hand-written third is the adapter contract — what stops the two-caller
// design from being a proof in prose.
//
// This file runs under real Node, with the oxlint tier's specs, because that is
// the harness that already has a Node runner. It imports `node:test`, which the
// neutrality contract in `overview.md` forbids the modules beside it: the
// contract governs what SHIPS into both runtimes, and a spec ships into neither.

//
