// ─── style/no-inline-font-size ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: No style object and no JSX prop sets `fontSize`. Every text size
// comes from a named entry on the type scale, so a change to the scale reaches
// every screen. When a surface needs a size the scale does not hold, you add it
// to the scale, and the next surface finds it there.
//
// The rule bans the property, not the value, and that is the whole of it. A
// version that reports only off-scale numbers leaves `fontSize: 13` in place
// wherever 13 is on the scale today, and that call site no longer follows the
// scale the day the scale moves.
//
// A JS plugin reads the JS and TS AST only. `font-size: 13px` in a `.css` file
// keeps this rule green; `style/css-tokens` is the check that reads that file.
//
// The subject is a property being SET, so only object-literal keys and JSX
// attribute names are read. Binding the name — `const { fontSize } = theme`, or
// the assignment form — is not covered: reading a size off the scale is not
// deciding one. Nothing here stops the bound value being handed to a style prop
// afterwards; the object literal that receives it is where that is caught.
//
// A computed key IS read where it names the property for certain — `{ ["fontSize"]: 13 }`
// reports, because the brackets are a spelling and not a different key. The line
// is at whether the name is statically known: `{ [size]: 13 }` names nothing a
// per-file rule can follow and is not covered. `lib/static-key-name.ts` owns
// where that line falls, for this rule and the nine others that ask.
//
// A default inside that pattern — `({ fontSize = 13 }: Props)` — is not read
// either, and that one costs real coverage: 13 is a raw size the file decides.
// It is left out because reporting it would mean judging the value on one
// branch while the rest of the rule judges only the key, and the two together
// read as arbitrary. A caller that passes the prop is still caught.
//
// Add `fontWeight`, `lineHeight` or `letterSpacing` to SCALE_PROPERTIES only
// when the tokens bundle them into one named variant. Where the tokens expose
// them separately, the ban names no fix, and a rule with no fix to name is one
// people disable.
//
// The tree's `themeModule` holds the scale itself and the documented raster
// boundaries — a canvas terminal, a PDF generator, a chart config takes a size
// as an API argument. Derive that number from the scale inside the exempt file.
//
// The domain layer is skipped because it carries no presentation, and the token
// source is skipped because it defines what everything else names. Both are
// `isStyleSubject` in lint/policy/layout.ts, which the whole style tier calls —
// these three rules and style/token-equality.
//
// The primitives layer is skipped too, and this is the ONE style rule that skips
// it. `size='caption'` — the fix the message names — has to become a real
// `fontSize` somewhere, and the primitive is where. Without the exemption the
// rule forbids its own fix, which is the same reason
// `style/no-inline-style-prop` and `style/no-raw-primitives` skip it, and this
// is the same `isAtProfile(role, "shared-ui")` call rather than a fourth
// private copy.
//
// Do NOT move that exemption into `isStyleSubject`. Its two siblings ban a
// VALUE, not a key, and the primitives layer has a compliant spelling for both
// — `theme.colors.surface`, `bg-surface` — so exempting them there would open a
// hole nothing earns. What separates this rule is that it bans the key, which
// is exactly what the primitive must write.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE, and it is the largest hole this rule has: the exemption is
// unconditional on the VALUE, so `fontSize: 13` inside the primitives layer is
// reported by NOTHING in the catalog. The siblings are silent there for their
// own reasons — a number is not a colour and not a class — and
// `style/token-equality` reads spacing and radius. This is the price of a
// key-only ban, and it is deliberate for the same reason the `({ fontSize = 13 })`
// default above is left out: reading the value inside the exemption while
// reading only the key everywhere else is a rule that judges by two standards.
// The primitives layer is small and hand-reviewed; if that stops being true,
// the answer is a check that reads the token SOURCE, not a value arm here.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
