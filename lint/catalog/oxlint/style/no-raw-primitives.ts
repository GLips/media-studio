// ─── style/no-raw-primitives ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Feature code renders through the design system's primitives, not
// the platform's raw elements. No file writes a bare `<div>`, and none takes
// `View` or `Text` from `react-native` by import, named re-export, or star
// re-export. A primitive takes token props only, so a call site names a token,
// never a px number or a hex.
//
// The primitives-layer exemption is mandatory: those files must use raw
// elements, so without it the rule forbids its own fix. Each RENDER_BOUNDARY
// path is one more file the rule does not read; give a reason about the
// boundary rather than about convenience.
//
// Do not add semantic elements (`nav`, `section`, `li`) back as exemptions for
// accessible markup. Give the primitive an `as` prop typed as a closed union
// (`<Box as='nav'>`). The compiler enforces a closed union; an exemption is
// a file this rule does not read.
//
// Do not ban `react-native` whole. `Platform`, `StyleSheet` and
// `useWindowDimensions` are correct in feature code, and a rule that fails a
// commit on correct code is one people disable.
//
// The platform arm fences on the NAME react-native hands over, however the file
// gets at it: a named import, an alias, a namespace or default import read as
// `RN.View`, `import RN = require("react-native")`, a `require()` or
// `await import()` destructure, and a bare `(await import("react-native")).View`.
// See lib/imported-names.ts for the spellings that deliberately report nothing —
// chiefly a computed key, an interpolated specifier, and a namespace passed on
// as a value.
//
// The two RE-EXPORT spellings that hand the module on WHOLE — `export *` and
// `export { default as RN }` — report on the module rather than on a name,
// because neither names one. They are the only spellings that reach code this
// rule will never open: the importer writes `RN.View` against a local module,
// and nothing in that file names react-native. `default` needs an arm of its own
// because the specifier walk compares against the primitive NAME set and
// `default` is in no such set — the same reason
// `boundary/ambient-globals` spells it out for `export { default as proc }`.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
