# style — Design-system adherence

Styling is where generated code drifts hardest and least visibly. A model reaches for a plausible gray, a raw `fontSize`, a `16px` where `"md"` was meant — each one defensible on its own, none of them canonically yours, and across enough generations the interface quietly stops matching itself. A design doc does not stop this: anything written in prose is a probability the model weighs against everything else in its context, not a guarantee. These rules make off-system styling *hard to express* rather than discouraged.

## Pick the tier before picking the rule

Enforcement runs in three tiers, and choosing the right one per axis is most of the work:

1. **Types** — closed props on your own primitives (a `tone`, not an open `color`; a `size` from a small union). The wrong value does not compile. This is the strongest tier and the cheapest; put every axis here that will fit. It is also the answer for "the variant value must come from the token union" — that is a type-system job, not a lint job.
2. **oxlint rules** — the escape hatches types leave open (component libraries that also accept any string, inline style objects, `className`). Per-file, real-time, JS/TS AST only.
3. **Structural checks** — anything needing the token source, cross-file knowledge, or the CSS surface, none of which a per-file JS/TS rule can reach.

The per-file half is below; the axes needing the token source, cross-file knowledge, or the CSS
surface are in [../../structural/style/overview.md](../../structural/style/overview.md).

Every rule below keys off two project facts: where the primitives layer lives (what the rules exempt) and which module owns each closed scale (what `token-equality` imports). Settle both before adapting anything here. If there is no design system yet, this tag is a later phase rather than a rule set to adapt now.

| Rule | Blocking | What it buys |
|---|---|---|
| [no-raw-primitives](no-raw-primitives.ts) | Yes | Feature code renders through the design system's primitives, so a call site names a token and never a px or a hex |
| [no-inline-color](no-inline-color.ts) | Yes | Every color comes from the token table, so a brand change or a dark theme is one edit |
| [no-inline-font-size](no-inline-font-size.ts) | Yes | Every text size comes from a named entry on the type scale, so one change to the scale reaches every screen |
| [no-inline-style-prop](no-inline-style-prop.ts) | Yes | Every declaration sits in token props or a named stylesheet entry — the strictest rule in the tag, and it needs a stylesheet layer to be right |
| [no-arbitrary-class-values](no-arbitrary-class-values.ts) | Yes | A utility class names a semantic token, so the theme config is the one place a size or a color changes |
| [no-stylex-border-shorthand](no-stylex-border-shorthand.ts) | Yes | A StyleX border takes a token through its longhands, since StyleX emits nothing for a shorthand whose value it can't read |
| [vendor-component-containment](vendor-component-containment.ts) | Yes | Every use of a wrapped component goes through the app wrapper, so a library swap is an edit to the wrapper |

## Who owns which edge

Two of these rules can see the same characters, and the split between them is deliberate. A colour
literal inside a utility class — `bg-[#0a0c10]` — is `no-arbitrary-class-values`', not
`no-inline-color`'s, because the only fix that terminates inside a class string is the mapped token
class. `no-inline-color`'s message names `var(--app-surface)`, and that written into a bracket is a
third diagnostic. Both match a colour with the one pattern in
[../lib/color-literals.ts](../lib/color-literals.ts), so they cannot drift into disagreeing about
what a colour is.

What the split does NOT cover is the rest of the JS. `no-inline-color` reads two positions — an
object property value, and a JSX attribute named `c`, `bg` or `color` — so `export const brand =
"#0a0c10"`, a palette array element, a returned literal and every other JSX prop are silent in both
rules and in the catalog. That is deliberate: a rule reading every string would report `href="#anchor"`
and every fragment id, and its header says so. It is coverage adopters do not have, not coverage
somewhere else.

The primitives layer is exempt from `no-raw-primitives`, `no-inline-style-prop` and
`no-inline-font-size`, and from nothing else here. Those three ban something a primitive must do to
implement a token prop — render the vendor component, write the `style` object, set the `fontSize`
key. The rest ban a VALUE, and a primitive has `theme.colors.surface` and `bg-surface` available to
it, so an exemption there would be a hole with nothing behind it. This is why the exemption is three
call sites of `isAtProfile(role, "shared-ui")` rather than a fourth condition inside
`isStyleSubject`, which all four style rules read.

Adoption mechanics, the spec contract, and what part of the tree owns each rule's subject: [../../overview.md](../../overview.md).
