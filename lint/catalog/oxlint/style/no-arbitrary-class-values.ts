// ─── style/no-arbitrary-class-values ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: A utility class names a semantic token. No `text-[13px]`, no
// `bg-[#0a0c10]`, no `bg-[var(--background)]`, and no step of the framework's
// own scale such as `text-sm`. To change the body size or the surface color,
// you edit the theme config once, and every class that names the token follows.
//
// The framework's theme config — `tailwind.config.ts` — writes the raw values
// the tokens resolve to, and needs no exemption here: it sits at the project
// root, outside every declared tree, so this rule is already silent there. A
// project that moves it INSIDE a declared tree has to name it in that tree's
// `themeModule`, which is the exemption this rule reads.
//
// The domain layer is skipped because it carries no presentation, and the token
// source is skipped because it defines what everything else names. Both are
// `isStyleSubject` in lint/policy/layout.ts, which the whole style tier calls —
// these three rules and style/token-equality. A domain cannot import a
// primitive at all, so a utility class in one is a placement problem that
// placement/topology and boundary/import-policy report; a styling diagnostic on
// top of theirs would prescribe a token where the fix is to move the file.
//
// This rule owns a COLOUR literal inside a bracket outright — `bg-[#0a0c10]`,
// `bg-[rgb(0,0,0)]` — and `style/no-inline-color` steps back from it, because
// the fix inside a class string is the mapped token class and that is this
// rule's `arbitraryValue` message. `lib/color-literals.ts` holds the pattern
// both rules match a colour with, so the two cannot drift into disagreeing
// about what a colour is.
//
// Add GENERIC_SCALE_UTILITY only after the semantic type classes exist
// (`text-body`, `text-caption`). Before that, an agent has a banned class and
// no allowed one, and it writes `text-[13px]` instead.
//
// A class built at run time (`` cn(`text-${size}`) ``) has no static text, and
// this rule passes it. Fix that at the type tier: a helper that takes a
// closed union of size names cannot produce an off-scale class.
//
// If the project has one sanctioned bracket use — a grid template, an animation
// keyframe — narrow ARBITRARY_VALUE_UTILITY to the prefixes you mean. Do not
// add a suppression convention: it exempts every prefix at once.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.

// `p-[7px]`, `text-[13px]`, `bg-[#fff]` — the arbitrary-value bracket syntax carrying a literal
// length, percentage, or color. A `md:` / `hover:` variant prefix sits before the match and does
// not interfere.
//
// The `\d` in front of the unit alternation is what makes this a VALUE match rather than a letter
// match, and it is the only thing keeping the arm off arbitraryVar's class. Drop it and `em` matches
// those two letters wherever they land, which is inside ordinary words: `has-[.item]:block`,
// `data-[theme=dark]:flex` and `input-[type=email]` are all real Tailwind and all report as raw
// values, and `bg-[var(--theme-surface)]` reports twice — once here and once as arbitraryVar — for
// one class with one fix. A unit with no number in front of it is not a value.
//
// A bracket holding BOTH a var and a literal — `bg-[var(--surface,#0a0c10)]`, a token with a raw
// fallback — does draw both arms, and that is right rather than a leak: it has both defects, the two
// messages name different halves of it, and doing what either one says leaves the other still true.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE, both directions. Only `px`, `rem`, `em` and `%` are units here, so `h-[100vh]`,
// `w-[2ch]` and `m-[10pt]` carry raw values and pass — extend the alternation if the project writes
// those. A real value inside an arbitrary VARIANT rather than an arbitrary value
// (`data-[size=2em]:flex`) reports, because nothing in a class string distinguishes the two; it is
// rarer than what the digit closes, and it is the residue. And the colour half ends at eight hex
// digits, so `bg-[#0123456789]` passes — that is `COLOR_LITERAL`'s word boundary, which is there so
// an anchor or a sha in a string value does not read as a colour, and it is worth more than a
// notation nothing renders.
