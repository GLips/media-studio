// ─── style/no-inline-color ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: No style-object value and no color prop carries a hex, `rgb()`,
// or `hsl()` literal. Every color in the JS and TSX source comes from the token
// table, and each token holds both schemes. To change the brand color, or to
// add a dark theme, you edit the token table and no component file.
//
// A JS plugin reads the JS and TS AST only. `color: #0a0c10` in a `.css` file
// keeps this rule green; `style/css-tokens` is the check that reads that file.
//
// A colour literal inside a utility class — `bg-[#0a0c10]` — is NOT this rule's
// finding. `style/no-arbitrary-class-values` owns it, because the fix inside a
// class string is the mapped token class (`bg-surface`), and this rule's own
// message prescribes `var(--app-surface)`, which as a class is that rule's
// `arbitraryVar`. One defect, two messages, and doing what either says leaves
// the other true. `lib/color-literals.ts` holds the boundary and the pattern
// both rules match with.
//
// Do not add bare color keywords (`red`, `dimmed`) to COLOR_LITERAL. Several
// token systems spell a token name as a keyword, so the rule would report the
// fix.
//
// Keep COLOR_PROPS small and exact. A rule that reads every attribute reports
// `href="#anchor"` and every fragment id.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE, and it is the widest one here: the rule reads exactly two
// POSITIONS — an object property value, and a JSX attribute whose name is in
// COLOR_PROPS. A hex anywhere else in the JS is covered by NOTHING in this
// catalog. `export const brand = "#0a0c10"`, an element of a palette array, a
// returned literal, and every JSX prop outside `{c, bg, color}` are all silent,
// and none of them is another rule's finding — the only rule that reads a colour
// elsewhere is `style/no-arbitrary-class-values`, and it reads bracket syntax
// inside a class string. Reading every string instead is what the COLOR_PROPS
// paragraph above refuses, so treat this silence as the price of a rule that
// reports nothing an author cannot act on — and never as coverage held
// somewhere else.
//
// The tree's `themeModule` also holds the documented raster boundaries — a
// canvas theme or a Skia paint takes a literal by contract. Derive it from the
// token there.
//
// The domain layer is skipped because it carries no presentation, and the token
// source is skipped because it defines what everything else names. Both are
// `isStyleSubject` in lint/policy/layout.ts, which the whole style tier calls —
// these three rules and style/token-equality. A project whose domains DO style
// edits it there, once, rather than in four places that can drift apart.
//
// The rule does not check that a `var(--x)` reference names a real token. That
// needs the token source, which a per-file linter cannot import.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE on the value side, and it is one line: only a value that IS a
// static string is read. A cast, a `satisfies`, a `!` and a parenthesis are
// stepped through, so `c={"#0a0c10" as Color}` is a finding — but a ternary, a
// logical, and a concatenation each ship something different from what they
// contain, and this rule has no answer for which arm is the colour. A literal
// assembled at run time is `style/token-equality`'s tier.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
