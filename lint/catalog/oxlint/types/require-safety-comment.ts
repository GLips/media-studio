// ─── types/require-safety-comment ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Every type assertion carries a `SAFETY:` comment that names the
// invariant. `rg "SAFETY:"` returns each place where the code overrules the
// compiler, so an audit of the assertions is one search. When you change a
// type, the comment tells you what to check again.
//
// Keep one marker. A second spelling such as `// JUSTIFY:` reads as a small
// improvement, and it means no single search finds every assertion.
//
// One comment covers every assertion in the statement it sits above. That is
// deliberate: one justified statement split into two assertions must not cost
// two identical sentences. It also means `value as unknown as User` passes with
// one comment, so take `types/no-chained-type-assertions` with this rule.
//
// `as const` needs no comment. It narrows a literal the compiler already reads
// and cannot be wrong. Remove the carve-out and people write empty sentences.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.

// Testing the PARENT rather than listing statement kinds is what makes `export const x = raw as T`
