// ─── types/no-chained-type-assertions ────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: No assertion routes through `unknown` to reach its target, in the
// `as`, the angle-bracket or the mixed spelling. Each assertion keeps the one
// check TypeScript still makes: the two types must overlap. So when you change
// a field on `User` and the source type no longer overlaps, the compiler
// reports the assertion. A chain through `unknown` still compiles.
//
// A chain of only `as const` links is legal. Those narrow literals and claim
// nothing about where a value came from. One non-const link anywhere in the
// chain reports the whole chain.
//
// The split spelling is invisible here. `const b: unknown = a; const c = b as T`
// is the same claim across two statements, and the assertions are not nested.
// `types/no-widen-then-assert` reads that flow; neither rule covers the other.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
