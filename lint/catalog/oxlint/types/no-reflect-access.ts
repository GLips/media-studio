// ─── types/no-reflect-access ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Property reads and calls keep their type checks. `Reflect.get`
// and `Reflect.apply` do not appear, in the dot or the bracket spelling. So a
// property rename reports at each read, and a call with the wrong number of
// arguments fails to compile rather than at run time.
//
// Only `get` and `apply` are in `BANNED_REFLECT_METHODS`. `Reflect.ownKeys`,
// `Reflect.has` and `Reflect.getPrototypeOf` return honest types and have no
// plain-syntax equivalent. Add `set` if the project has the same problem with
// property writes.
//
// A `Proxy` handler legitimately calls `Reflect.get` — that is the documented
// way to write a trap that forwards to the target. Each trap is one
// `oxlint-disable-next-line`, the same answer the instantiated-namespace case
// below gets. No directory silences this rule, and the vocabulary names none
// for it.
//
// `Reflect` is resolved as a REFERENCE, not matched by name, so a local binding
// called `Reflect` does not report. The spec pins that, and pins the other half
// too — a `Reflect` bound in a scope the use site is not inside does not cover it.
//
// The question the resolution asks is whether the binding puts a VALUE in the file,
// and that is not a detail: both shorter spellings of it answer differently
// under the oxlint CLI than under RuleTester, so a rule reading either one is
// green in its spec and silent in the linter. `resolvesToLocalBinding` says which
// and why. Proving this rule fires therefore takes a real `oxlint` run over a real
// file, and no spec can substitute; the catalog does it in
// `harness/prove-no-reflect-access-live.ts`, and a project adapting this rule owes
// itself the equivalent.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE. The subject is the identifier `Reflect` and the member read off
// it — the READ, not the call, so `Reflect.get.call(…)` and `const get =
// Reflect.get` are covered. What stays out of reach is every spelling that puts the
// builtin somewhere ELSE first, before any member is read off the identifier:
// `globalThis.Reflect.get(…)` names it through another object; `const R = Reflect`
// and — cheapest of all — `const Reflect = globalThis.Reflect` rebind it, the second
// without touching a single call site; `const { get } = Reflect` takes the method
// off it without ever naming `get` as a member. Each hands back the same `any`.
// Covering them means either tracking values, which one file's syntax cannot do
// honestly, or matching the member name alone, which reports every `cache.get(key)`
// in the codebase — and a rule that fires on correct code is one people learn to
// disable. A codebase that wants the whole family closed wants a type-aware check,
// which no rule in this catalog is.
//
// REPORTS CORRECT CODE, in three shapes. A `namespace Reflect` with value members
// really does bind the name, as does an `import Reflect = <that namespace>`, and
// this reports on both; `bindsAValue` says why the erased kinds and the instantiated
// ones are refused together. The third comes from visiting the read rather than the
// call: a value-position `typeof Reflect.get === "function"` feature-detect reports,
// because it is the same member read off the same identifier and nothing in one
// file's syntax separates probing the builtin from using it. (The TYPE-position
// `type G = typeof Reflect.get` is a type query, not a member expression, and is
// silent.) The spec asserts all three rather than leaving them to this paragraph.
//
// Not reachable through an adopter's config, which is the obvious next attack and
// worth stating: declaring `Reflect` in oxlint's `globals` or turning on an `env`
// that carries it changes what the global SCOPE holds and not what any definition
// says, and this reads definitions. Measured on 1.77.0.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.

// Whether the name resolves to a binding THIS FILE declares a VALUE for, rather than to the
// language builtin.
//
// Two obvious ways to ask this are each right in exactly one of the two hosts the rule runs in,
// and silently wrong in the other. Measured on oxlint 1.77.0, both hosts:
//
//   under the oxlint CLI     the global scope declares `Reflect`, and `isGlobalReference` is true
//   under RuleTester         no global scope is populated, and `isGlobalReference` is false
//
// So `isGlobalReference` cannot be read — it answers opposite things about the same identifier.
// Neither can a scope-chain walk that looks the NAME up. It gets the SHADOWING wrong: a name is
// bound by every declaration that spells it, in value space and type space alike, so a `type
// Reflect = never` inside a function hides the real `const Reflect` outside it and the rule fires
// on a call that is genuinely local. A reference resolves to the binding the CALL uses. (The name
// walk is also what made this rule inert, when it returned on any binding at all rather than
// asking each definition — the CLI's global scope binds `Reflect` for every use.)
//
// Asking the RESOLVED REFERENCE agrees in both, and an unresolved one is the builtin — nothing in
// the file declares it. Under the CLI it resolves instead to a global-scope variable with no
// definitions, which says the same thing. `lib/imported-names.ts` reaches for the resolver over a
// name lookup for the same reason, spelled `require`.
//
// The walk to `upper` is not a name walk in disguise. A reference is recorded on the scope that
// CONTAINS it, which for a `switch` discriminant is the scope above the one `getScope` returns —
// so a lookup in a single scope misses it, `resolved` comes back undefined, and the rule reports
// on a local binding it should have left alone. `switch (Reflect.get(…))` with a `const Reflect`
// in the file is that false positive.
// Takes the identifier as a plain `Node`, because it arrives through
// `withoutTransparentWrappers` — which answers "what is this value" and cannot know that this
// caller narrowed it to an identifier. The two fields read here are on every identifier node.

// Whether one definition of the resolved variable puts a value in the file at run time.
//
// Asked per definition and not per variable, because TypeScript MERGES declarations into one:
// `interface Reflect {…}` beside `declare const Reflect: Reflect` is a single variable with two
// definitions, and reading only the first said "this file binds Reflect" about two declarations
// that between them bind nothing. Both halves compile under `--strict` and emit the call verbatim.
//
// Three ways a definition binds nothing, each a one-line file-wide off-switch otherwise:
//
//   a type-space KIND       `type Reflect = never` and `interface Reflect {}`. The resolver skips
//       these when they stand alone — a value reference resolves past them to the builtin — but
//       NOT when they merge with a value declaration, which is why the kind is read here rather
//       than left to the resolver. `Definition["type"]` as `@oxlint/plugins` declares it does not
//       list these; the runtime produces them, measured.
//   `declare`               describes something that already exists. Nothing carrying it
//       introduces a runtime binding — const, function, class, namespace or module — and an
//       ambient `.d.ts` never reaches this rule at all, so the arm suppresses no legitimate case.
//   a type-only import      `import type { Reflect }` and `import { type Reflect }`. The resolver
//       does NOT skip these the way it skips a type alias, so both spellings have to be read:
//       `importKind` sits on the DECLARATION for the first and on the SPECIFIER for the second.
//   an alias to an ENTITY    `import Reflect = NodeJS`, which is a one-line off-switch in any
//       project carrying `@types/node` — or `= JSX` in any React one — and erases to nothing at
//       all. Its definition claims `importKind: "value"` on both the node and its parent, which
//       is why the arm above does not catch it. The `= require("…")` spelling of the same syntax
//       DOES bind a value and is left alone, so the moduleReference is what separates them.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE, in the false-positive direction, and it is the reason `TSModuleName` is refused
// by kind rather than by inspection: an INSTANTIATED namespace — `namespace Reflect { export const
// get = … }` — does bind a value, and this reports on it. Telling it from the erased kind means
// reimplementing TypeScript's instantiation rule, to buy silence on a namespace shadowing a
// language builtin. A real instance is one `oxlint-disable-next-line`; the uninstantiated half
// left open is a file-wide off-switch with no bound.
//
// `TSEnumName` is deliberately absent from the list, and that is a verdict rather than an
// omission: an enum emits a real object, so the name really is bound. The ambient spellings that
// do erase — `declare enum` — carry the `declare` flag and are refused by the arm below.
