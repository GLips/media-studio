// ─── react/single-component-export ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Shows: The files that export more than one component. A component that
// shares a file has no file with its name. A text search for that name finds
// the uses and not the declaration. The message gives all of the names, thus
// you know which component to move.
//
// The `Object.assign` exemption must hold. It is the shape this rule's message
// tells people to write, and a report against it teaches people to ignore the
// rule. If a project groups compound components under one export some other
// way, add that spelling to `isCompoundNamespace`.
//
// Do not add a declaration form to this file. `lib/component-declarations.ts`
// answers "what is a component" for `react/hook-count` and `react/prop-count`
// too, and that includes the export-list spelling this rule cares about most —
// `const Card = …; const CardRow = …; export { Card, CardRow }` is the file this
// rule exists for. A second answer here makes the three rules govern different
// sets of files.
//
// This rule gives a warning and does not stop the build. A second component in
// a file is sometimes correct, and only the author knows. The rule reports the
// names and leaves the decision to the author.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
