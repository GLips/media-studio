// ─── react/prop-count ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Shows: Each exported component that declares the threshold number of props or
// more, and the count. A reader learns which components make every call site
// supply many values, and which one to split next. The rule only warns, so the
// count is a report and not a property you can depend on.
//
// The rule never adds the annotation and the destructure together. `({ a, b }:
// { a: string; b: string })` declares the same two props twice, and a sum
// doubles every name. Names merge as a SET for the same reason: `Model & {
// tone?: Tone }` is one prop in TypeScript and must be one prop here.
//
// Only BASES expand. A member with a named type — `result: ScanResultViewModel`
// — is one prop. To expand it makes the rule report the shape it asks for:
// props that a call site always passes together, put into one object.
//
// A base this rule cannot read in this file adds nothing, and the count becomes
// a floor. A JS plugin gets no type checker, thus the rule cannot read a type
// that another file declares. The message says "at least N props" and names
// the base. A missing report does not mean the true count is below the
// threshold, and a report on every `extends ViewProps` is a permanent warning
// that a person cannot act on. A floor can miss a wide component. It cannot
// report one that is not wide.
//
// A prop whose NAME is not statically known makes the count a floor for the same
// reason a base does. `({ ["a"]: a })` and `{ ["a"]: string }` resolve — one
// owner answers "what key is this", and the quoted spelling is a key like any
// other — but `({ [k]: v })` names nothing, and the floor wording is what says
// so. A rule that dropped it and kept the confident wording would be reporting a
// number it had already decided was incomplete.
//
// The parameter is read through `lib/parameter-shapes.ts`, so a defaulted or
// rest-spelled parameter carries its annotation to this rule the same way it
// does to the `types` tag. NEGATIVE SPACE: a rest parameter declares the shape of
// an ARGUMENT LIST rather than a props type — `(...props: [P])` annotates a tuple
// and `(...{ a, b })` destructures the arguments array — so a component spelled
// that way gets no report from this rule at all. A union of prop shapes is a
// floor for the same reason: this rule reads one shape, and a union has members
// this walk never reaches.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
