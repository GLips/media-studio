// ─── react/hook-count ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Shows: Each exported component that makes 7 or more hook calls, and the
// count. To test such a component, a developer must set up every one of its
// hooks, and this count is that number. The rule warns and does not fail the
// build, because some components collect independent hooks by design.
//
// The count is per component and not per file. A file that holds a component
// and the custom hook extracted out of it is the shape this rule asks for. A
// sum over the file reports that shape as the problem.
//
// A custom hook is never a subject. It is the target of the extraction, and a
// report against it tells the author that the extraction was of no use. The
// classifier keys on the capital letter, thus `usePanelState` is not a
// component and gets no count of its own.
//
// Hook calls in nested callbacks and in conditionals count. To skip them looks
// more correct, because the rules of hooks do not permit them there. But then
// this rule and the React lint plugin disagree about what a hook call is.
//
// No kind of hook counts for more than another. Seven `useState` calls and
// seven different hooks are the same finding, and which hooks matter most is
// a judgement for the reader.
//
// Which calls ARE hooks is `lib/hook-calls.ts`'s answer, shared with
// react/no-async-effect — `React.useEffect(…)` counts,
// and an import counts under the name the EXPORTING module gave it — so
// `useEffect as useE` is a hook and `createStore as useStore` is not. That file
// states the rest of what does not count.
//
// Two components in one file is react/single-component-export's finding.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
