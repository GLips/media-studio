// ─── react/no-async-effect ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Every useEffect that does async work returns a cleanup
// function, and no useCallback is async. The effect has one place to set a
// cancelled flag or to abort the request. A `setState` after an `await` does
// not run against a component that React already removed. No async
// useCallback exists, so you never trace one to the effect that calls it.
//
// A `return () => …` anywhere in the effect callback counts as cleanup. To
// read what the cleanup does looks stricter, but it reports effects that
// cancel correctly, and an author answers that with a suppression comment.
//
// Async work is `await`, an async arrow, an async function, and a `.then`
// call. Do not drop the `.then` arm because the `async` flag covers the rest:
// a promise chain has no `async` keyword and starts the same request.
//
// The useCallback arm reports an async useCallback wherever it appears, with
// no test that an effect calls it. That call is often in another file, and
// this rule reads one file. Delete the arm and the indirect form gets no
// report.
//
// The rule reads the extensions that can hold JSX and no others. Move a hook
// into a sibling use*.ts file, a refactor this catalog asks for elsewhere, and
// this rule no longer reads its effects. NEGATIVE SPACE, and nothing else in the
// catalog closes it: an async effect in a hook module draws no report at all.
//
// Which calls are `useEffect` and `useCallback` is `lib/hook-calls.ts`'s answer,
// shared with react/hook-count — `React.useEffect(…)`
// counts, and an import counts under the name the EXPORTING module gave it, so
// `useEffect as useE` is a hook and `createStore as useStore` is not. That file
// states the rest of what does not count.
//
// The messages below name TanStack Query. That name is the fix instruction, not a
// detail: a project on SWR, on Apollo, or on a route loader must edit the message
// text to name what it uses. A message that names a package the project does not
// have tells the reader to install one.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
