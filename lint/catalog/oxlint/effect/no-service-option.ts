// ─── effect/no-service-option ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Every service a program uses stays in its requirements type.
// Delete a layer from a composition, or forget one in a new environment,
// and the compiler names the missing service where the layers compose. You
// not learn it later from a feature that runs, takes the `None` path, and
// does nothing.
//
// `Effect.serviceOptional` is a different API and stays out of the set. It
// fails with `NoSuchElementException`, so an absent service is still an
// error. Add it only if the project wants that absence to be a compile
// error rather than a runtime one.
//
// A dependency that may legitimately be absent — a metrics sink, a feature
// flag source — keeps its requirement and gets a no-op layer as its
// implementation. The choice then sits in layer composition, where a
// reader sees it. Say this the first time the rule reports, or the rule
// reads as an obstacle and someone turns it off.
//
// The name is matched without a namespace test, so `Effect.serviceOption`,
// a namespace alias, and a bare imported `serviceOption(…)` all report. An
// aliased import reports nothing; this tier has no scope resolution.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
