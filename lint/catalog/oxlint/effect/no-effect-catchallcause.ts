// ─── effect/no-effect-catchallcause ───────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: A handler only sees the errors that its effect declares —
// no `Effect.catchAllCause`, no `Effect.catchAllDefect`. A thrown
// exception, a broken invariant, or an interruption ends the fiber and
// reaches the runtime, which logs the whole cause. So a bug reports as one
// crash with a stack and a location, and never as a business outcome.
//
// `catchAllDefect` sits in the set with `catchAllCause` because it is the
// next spelling a person writes once the first one reports. Drop it only
// for a real defect-quarantine boundary — a plugin host, a job runner that
// isolates third-party handlers — and keep that boundary in one named
// module rather than the whole tree.
//
// Cause INSPECTION is not the target. `Effect.sandbox`,
// `Effect.tapErrorCause`, `Cause.pretty`, and an `Effect.catchSomeCause`
// that narrows to one known defect all read the cause and leave it in
// place. Add them to the set and the rule reports correct code.
//
// The member name is matched without a namespace test, so
// `Effect.catchAllCause`, a namespace alias, and a bare imported
// `catchAllCause(…)` all report. An aliased import
// (`import { catchAllCause as recover }`) reports nothing; this tier has
// no scope resolution.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
