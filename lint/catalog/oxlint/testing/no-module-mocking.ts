// ─── testing/no-module-mocking ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Every test runs the real module that it names. A change to a
// function's signature or to its behaviour fails the tests that cover it. You
// do not read each test after an edit, to find the mocks that no longer match
// the module. You can move a module to a different path without an edit to
// the tests that named the old path.
//
// This rule reports in test files. Every other rule in this catalog calls
// `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` and skips them. A person who makes this rule match
// the others takes away its only subject, and the rule then reports nothing at
// all.
//
// It follows that this rule reads NO declared tree, and it is the only one in
// the catalog that does not. Its scope is therefore whatever oxlint hands it —
// so it is enabled in the shipped config's GLOBAL block rather than behind a
// tree glob, and a project that scopes it to a tree silently stops it reporting
// on every suite outside one, the repo-root `test/` directory included. The
// spec harness derives that placement from this file and fails the build if the
// config disagrees, in either direction.
//
// `MOCK_METHODS` holds all four member spellings of the same replacement that
// jest and vitest ship. `mock` is the common one; `doMock` defers it,
// `setMock` fills the registry slot by hand, and `unstable_mockModule` is the
// ESM spelling. Match `mock` alone and the other three are each a way to write
// the same finding and get no report — which is the shape an author lands on
// once the common name starts reporting. The list is enumerated rather than
// derived, so a name a runner adds later is a name this list is missing; check
// it against the jest object API when a runner majors.
//
// Do not add `vi.fn`, `vi.spyOn`, the fake timers or an MSW handler. Each of
// those replaces a boundary, and each is what the message asks the author to
// write instead. A rule that reports them names no edit the author can make.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE, and it is a hole rather than a decision. `isTestFrameworkObject`
// resolves a bare Identifier, so THREE spellings of the same mock go unreported:
// a namespace import (`import * as vitest from "vitest"; vitest.mock(…)`), a
// renamed binding (`import { vi as v } from "vitest"; v.mock(…)`), and bun:test's
// `import { mock } from "bun:test"; mock.module(…)`, which is not a member call on
// a framework object at all.
//
// The first two are covered by `jest/no-restricted-jest-methods`, which reports
// every fixture this rule reports, with this message text verbatim — the two are
// interchangeable on the cases here. It is not enabled, and the reason is worth
// keeping here rather than only in the config: taking it moves `MOCK_METHODS` out
// of this file and into `.oxlintrc.json`. The spec beside this rule travels into
// the adopting repo, so today an adopter who drops `unstable_mockModule` breaks a
// fixture in their own build; a config key dropped there breaks nothing anywhere,
// and no guard in this catalog can reach them. The third spelling is missed by
// both.
