// ─── placement/no-deprecated-input-validator ──────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: Server functions and middleware use one spelling, `.validator()`.
// The rename covers the whole tree and not the files someone opened, thus a
// search for `.validator(` finds every checked chain. You read one method name,
// not two, to know whether a handler checks its input.
//
// Both builders share the deprecation. A rule that names createServerFn alone
// leaves middleware on the old method, and middleware checks a request before
// the handler runs.
//
// The method name alone does not identify the builder. Require a mention of
// createServerFn or createMiddleware inside the receiver, or an unrelated
// object with an `.inputValidator()` method of its own gets a report it cannot
// act on.
//
// A chain still on `.inputValidator()` OFTEN also reports at
// placement/server-fn-validation, which reads the name `.validator()` and no
// other. The two say different things — rename the method here, add a check at
// all there — and either fix satisfies both, so there is no edit loop between
// them. What there is NOT is agreement about which chains they see. This rule
// reads the receiver's whole source range for a factory mention;
// server-fn-validation walks a chain of plain dotted calls and stops at the
// first thing that is not one. So on the computed spelling
// (`createServerFn()["inputValidator"](s)`), on a cast wedged into the chain,
// and on `createMiddleware` — which is not in that rule's factory set at all —
// this rule reports alone. Do not read a finding here as evidence that the
// handler is validated; that is the other rule's question and it may never have
// been asked.
//
// The deprecation is in @tanstack/start-plugin-core/src/start-compiler/,
// handleCreateServerFn.ts and handleCreateMiddleware.ts.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
