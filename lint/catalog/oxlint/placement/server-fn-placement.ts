// Makes sure: The name createServerFn appears only under
// features/<name>/controllers/. To read every endpoint a feature exposes, you
// open one directory. You do not search the whole tree for a definition that
// sits in a UI file or in an infrastructure helper.
//
// The subject is the name and not a call shape. A module outside controllers/
// has no reason to name the factory at all, thus the rule reports the import as
// well. Do not narrow the rule to `createServerFn(...)`. An alias at the import
// (`createServerFn as makeFn`) or a namespace access (`start.createServerFn()`)
// then passes, and the definition under it passes too.
//
// The message names the destination, features/<name>/controllers/. A message
// that only refuses leaves the author with the same question, and that author
// turns the rule off.
//
// A file inside controllers/ is not correct for that reason alone. Whether the
// server function checks its input is placement/server-fn-validation's finding.
// What else the module exports is
// placement/no-plain-export-in-server-fn-module's.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
