//
// Makes sure: Every pgTable and relations declaration sits in
// infrastructure/db/schema/. The migration tool reads that one directory, thus
// a generate run covers every table and no column the code expects is absent
// from the database. You read the whole data model, foreign keys and relations
// included, at one address.
//
// Generated migrations restate the schema and report nothing — because they sit
// outside every declared tree, not because this rule exempts them. There is no
// exemption for generated output of any kind; the one path this rule reads is
// the schema DESTINATION itself. A project that puts its migration output INSIDE
// a declared tree gets a report on every generated file, which is the shape that
// makes a person turn the rule off; move the output or name its directory as
// generated, and do not add a second path arm here.
//
// SCHEMA_DECLARATIONS is a closed set of names. A dialect outside it —
// `mysqlTable` in a project that also uses postgres — gets no check, and its
// tables pass at any address. Add every dialect the project uses on the day of
// adoption.
//
// The rule reports the call and not the export. A declaration nested in a
// factory or in an object literal is a table all the same, and it gets the same
// report as a top-level `export const`.
//
// A table at the right address says nothing about who may query it. That is
// boundary/db-isolation's finding.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
