// ─── boundary/ambient-globals ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: `process.env`, `import.meta.env`, `fetch` and `localStorage` are
// read in one module each: the tree's env modules, its API client, and its
// browser storage wrapper. To give every request a timeout, or every stored key
// one name and one format, you edit one file. A missing variable fails at boot
// in the env module, and not as an undefined deep inside a request.
//
// A global is never imported, so no rule that reads specifiers can fence one.
// This is the rule for a capability that the module graph does not mention.
//
// Write `globalPath` HOST-FREE: `localStorage`, not `window.localStorage`. The
// rule strips `window`, `globalThis`, `self` and `global` before it matches, so
// one entry covers every host spelling and the computed forms. A dotted path
// (`process.env`) matches that prefix and everything under it.
//
// `alsoImportedFrom` covers a capability that a module also exports, where the
// module spelling avoids every check that matches a global. It is a LIST of
// module names — `["node:process", "process"]`, matched exactly — and every
// spelling of the module that a project actually writes is a row rather than a
// pattern to be widened later. The re-export is the one to understand:
// `export { env } from "node:process"` gives the capability to every importer of
// this module, and the file that writes it reads nothing.
//
// A global that is not on the list is unrestricted. Keep the list to the
// capabilities with a real owner; a longer one teaches people the rule is
// arbitrary, and that is what gets it disabled.
//
// This rule is the SOLE owner of `fetch`, in every file of every declared tree,
// and the catalog holds no second fence for it. The `fetch` row's `why` is the
// whole fix instruction, which is why it names the request concerns AND the
// caching one: two components asking for the same data through the owner make
// one request and share one cache entry, and that is the value a component-only
// ban was there for.
//
// Do not add a `.tsx`-only companion beside it. The natural way to write one is
// to match the callee NAME, which reports `const fetch = useFetcher()` and
// `function Row({ fetch })` and goes silent on `globalThis["fetch"]` and
// `(globalThis as never).fetch` — the four rows the reference walk below gets
// right. Two fences on one global also report two diagnostics naming two
// different destinations for one violation.
//
// Scope is the declared trees, so vite.config.ts and next.config.js are
// unaffected — they sit outside every one of them. What the BUILD reads is a
// different question from what value the app reads at runtime, and one
// exemption for both gets reused for runtime code.
//
// The rule resolves references, so a local binding that shadows the name,
// `client.fetch()` and `{ fetch: 1 }` are not reads. A rebound host
// (`const g = globalThis; g.localStorage`) and a computed key that is not a
// string literal are not matched: nothing per-file can follow either one. A
// type-only import is erased and reads nothing.
//
// Where `alsoImportedFrom` names a module for a DOTTED path — which is what
// that field is for — every spelling that reaches it is one read: a named,
// default or namespace import, `import x = require()`, `require()` and
// `await import()`, bound, destructured, or read straight off the load
// expression. A bare `globalPath` gets no `alsoImportedFrom` at all, and the
// policy type refuses the pairing rather than half-honouring it: the module
// object stands in for the segments above the capability, and a bare path has no
// segment above it.
//
// NONE of those spellings is walked here. `lib/imported-names.ts` owns every one
// of them, for this rule and for the two style rules that fence on names, and
// this rule asks it the same question they do — which names does this file take
// from these modules — then matches the answer against the last segment of each
// `globalPath`. So its blind spots are this rule's: a specifier that is not a
// literal or a substitution-free template, a computed key that is not a string
// literal, a module bound by assignment rather than declaration, a destructure
// that binds no name at all, the INNER name of a nested destructure — for the
// `process.env` row `const { env: { KEY } } = …` reports, because `env` is the
// key the module hands over and the row's capability; a row whose capability sat
// at the inner name instead would not — and
// `import("node:process").then(({ env }) => …)`, where the name is a callback
// parameter and following it means following the promise. The capability passed
// on as a value (`f(process)`) is not followed either, by that file or this one.
//
// DEPTH is not a blind spot, and the arithmetic holds at any: the module object
// stands in for every segment of the `globalPath` above the LAST, so a row
// `a.b.c` makes `require("m").c` the read and `require("m").a` nothing. This is
// the one place the module spellings and the global walk describe the path
// differently — the global walk matches `a.b.c` whole — and they agree on which
// read is the capability, which is what matters. Every arm answers through
// `capabilityExport` so there is one answer rather than one per arm; the
// previous regex-selected version had two arms disagreeing about it, and no row
// deep enough to show it.
//
// Re-exports are the one module spelling this file still walks itself. That file
// answers what a module hands to THIS file; a re-export hands it to code neither
// of them sees, and both the blame node and the message differ.
//
// A module spelling not in the list is not covered, and there is no near-miss
// matching: a wrapper package that re-exports `env` under its own name, a
// subpath, or a bundler alias reaches the capability and reports nothing. That
// is the price of the list being enumerable, and it is the right price — the
// alternative is a pattern, which an adopter widens until the capability has no
// owner. Add the spelling as a row.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
