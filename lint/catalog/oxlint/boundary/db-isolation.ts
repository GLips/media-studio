// ─── boundary/db-isolation ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: `@/infrastructure/db` is imported only from infrastructure/,
// features/*/repo/ and features/*/controllers/. To add a tenant filter to every
// query, or to find each caller of a table, you read three directories. A UI
// file cannot reach the database client, so the build puts no database driver in
// the browser bundle.
//
// The DB alias comes from the resolved tree's `dbDir` and alias prefix, which is
// also where boundary/layer-occupancy reads the schema path. A project with a
// flat `@/db` moves the directory THERE and both rules follow. A path written
// out again here is how the two rules end up with different paths.
//
// A raw ORM or driver package is not matched here. Containment of a package is
// boundary/sdk-containment's question, and its owner rows answer it.
//
// A relative specifier reaches the same module and no pattern here sees it.
// Adopt boundary/import-policy in the structural tier with this rule.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
