//
// Makes sure: A package with a row on the owner table is imported only in the
// modules that own it. To change the Stripe API version, or to drop a field from
// the analytics payload, you open one file, and the call sites you find are all
// of them. A UI file cannot construct the server SDK, so its secret key stays
// out of the browser bundle.
//
// This is deliberately NOT a row in `arch/import-policy`'s table. That table is
// keyed by area; this policy is keyed by exact package and exact module. One
// table for both forces `domain → package` to state that a domain may import any
// package — a cell that says something untrue so the machinery can work.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE: a package with no row is UNCONSTRAINED, and this rule cannot
// detect that state. Whether a package reaches a network, a keychain or a
// filesystem is a judgement, not something a check decides; the nearest
// mechanical proxy flags React and still misses the first bad import. A new SDK
// needs its row, and nothing reminds you.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE: there is no entrypoint exemption and no way to spell one. An
// entrypoint that genuinely has to set an SDK up owns it, and says so on that
// package's `owners` list — a decision one row records, rather than a category of
// file that inherits a pass. A filename that inherits a pass exempts every import
// in the file, not the one import the entrypoint needs.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
