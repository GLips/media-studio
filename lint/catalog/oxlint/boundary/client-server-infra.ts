// ─── boundary/client-server-infra ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: A client file imports only the infrastructure modules on
// `CLIENT_SAFE_INFRASTRUCTURE`. The build puts no database client, no server
// auth module, no SDK wrapper and no telemetry key in a browser chunk. To learn
// what the browser takes from the infrastructure layer, you read that list.
//
// A route loader is a client context: @tanstack/router-core calls
// route.options.loader from the shared load path, which the browser runs too. Do
// not exempt a loader.
//
// A file named `*.server.ts` is a server context wherever it sits, so this rule
// does not check it. That exemption is about the BUNDLE — the file is never in a
// client chunk — and it is not a permission to import infrastructure. Inside a
// feature it usually is not one: `index.server.ts` classifies as the feature
// barrel and `notify.server.ts` as a feature-root file, and
// boundary/import-policy denies infrastructure to both. The rename removes this
// finding and creates that one.
//
// Each entry in `CLIENT_SAFE_INFRASTRUCTURE` matches the specifier EXACTLY. An
// entry that ends with `(?:\/|$)` instead of `$` admits a whole subtree, and the
// browser then gets every module in it.
//
// A relative specifier reaches the same module and no pattern here sees it.
// Adopt boundary/import-policy in the structural tier with this rule.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.

 *
 * NEGATIVE SPACE: `studio-engine.server` is the app's one door into lib/engine
