// ─── boundary/import-policy ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Makes sure: One table decides every aliased specifier and every bare package
// name inside a declared tree. A feature and a domain are reached at their barrel, so you
// move a file inside one and no file outside it changes. `@/env.server` reaches
// no client file, and a domain takes no runtime package.
//
// This rule holds no policy of its own — no path regexes, no allowlists, no
// direction rules. It classifies the file and hands each specifier to
// lint/policy/import-policy.ts, which the structural tier reads too. A change to
// enforcement belongs in that table; a change that does not fit the table is a
// question the table was not built to answer.
//
// RELATIVE SPECIFIERS are not visible here. A linter cannot resolve one — where
// `../../beta/service` lands depends on the depth of the file that names it — so
// they belong to boundary/import-policy in the structural tier. Neither adapter
// needs to know what the other reported: a package has no relative spelling, and
// a relative path has no meaning without the tree.
//
// Suppress per line and never per file: `// oxlint-disable-next-line
// arch/import-policy`. A file-level disable of a merged rule removes every
// invariant at once, which no single case justifies.
//
// SCOPE, and it is the same for every TREE-SCOPED rule in this catalog — which
// is every rule but `testing/no-module-mocking`, whose subject is a test file and
// which is therefore enabled globally. This rule is silent outside the declared
// trees, and silent on the files `isArchitectureExemptSourcePath` names inside
// them — tests, scripts, generated and ambient modules. Neither
// silence is coverage. `lib/define-tree-rule.ts` owns both, which is why no rule
// body checks either one.
