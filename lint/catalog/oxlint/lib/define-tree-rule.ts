// ─── The tree gate, as a wrapper rather than a line every rule remembers ──
//
// Every architecture rule in this catalog is silent outside the declared trees.
// That was 49 copies of the same two lines at the top of 49 `create` bodies, and
// two lines a rule can simply not have are not an invariant — they are a
// convention. A rule that loses them keeps every one of its specs green, because
// every spec filename is INSIDE a declared tree: there is nothing in the
// three-kind contract that asks what the rule does outside one.
//
// A harness check that greps rule sources for `classifyFileRole` does not close
// this. It proves the identifier is present, not that it controls execution —
// delete the condition and leave the import, and the grep still passes. That was
// the state this file replaces, and it is exactly the "silently stops matching"
// failure the catalog exists to prevent.
//
// So the gate is not something a rule does. `create` is handed a `FileRole` that
// cannot be undefined, and the only way to obtain one is through this wrapper.
// A rule cannot opt out by forgetting.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE, and it is the point of the second export: a rule whose subject
// is NOT application source uses plain `defineRule` and is enabled globally.
// `testing/no-module-mocking` is the only one — its subject is test files, which
// `classifyFileRole` reports as no subject at all. Membership here is what the
// spec harness reads to decide which block of the shipped config a rule belongs
// in, in both directions, so the two cannot disagree.
