// Every place a module specifier can appear: the four static forms, `import()`, the two CommonJS
// spellings, `import x = require(…)`, and `import("…")` in type position. Boundary rules fence on
// the specifier string, and a fence that misses one form is one `await import()` — or one
// `export … from` — away from useless, so they all go through here rather than each rule picking
// the node types it happened to think of.
//
// This is the single biggest correctness win of the port. Under GritQL the same coverage needed
// `or { JsModuleSource() as $source, \`import($source)\` }` pasted into every boundary template,
// and the templates that forgot the second arm silently ignored dynamic imports.
//
// `require()` and `require.resolve()` are here because the resolved import graph retains both and
// this helper did not, so the two tiers disagreed about what an import even IS — and a rule the
// graph would have caught passed the linter. This is NOT a prohibition on CommonJS: the two
// spellings create the same dependency, so a rule about dependencies has to see both.
// `typescript/no-require-imports` exists if the prohibition is ever wanted as well.
//
// The TypeScript-only spellings are here for the same reason the CommonJS ones are: they compile,
// they name an aliased module, and the tier that owns aliased specifiers is this one. A form that
// only this tier can see is a form that escapes BOTH tiers when it is missed, because the resolved
// graph skips every non-relative edge.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE: a computed specifier — `import(path)`, `require(name)`, an interpolated template
// — is not visited, because there is nothing to fence on. A template with no substitutions IS
// checkable and is visited. `boundary/ambient-globals` does not read this helper at all: its
// subject is a global rather than a module edge, and the module spellings it does recognise are
// one field on one policy row.

 * The one module a specifier expression names, with the node to blame for it — or `undefined` when

 * A computed specifier (`import(path)`, `require(name)`) has nothing to fence on. A literal is
 * checkable, and so is a template with no substitutions — ``import(`@/shared/utils`)`` is the same
 * edge, and the backtick is exactly the spelling someone reaches for to make a fence stop matching.
 * Both forms are answered here rather than by each caller, because the caller that answered for
 * itself is the one that carried the literal and forgot the template.
 *
 * THE ONE OWNER of "is this specifier statically known, and what is it". A second private copy —
 * `lib/imported-names.ts` is where one would go — agreeing on every input today is the reason to
 * merge it here rather than a reason to keep it. Two copies diverge in COVERAGE before they diverge
 * in behaviour: the same backtick bypass has to be closed in each, and the fixture written for one
 * asserts nothing about the other. So ``import(`@/infrastructure/db/${name}`)`` — the negative
 * space this module's header names — is pinnable on one side and unpinned on the other, with
 * nothing reporting the next patch that lands on one side only.
 *
 * The return is an object because the two callers want different halves: `visitModuleSources` blames
 * a node and `runtimeImportSpecifier` returns a bare string. A superset of both is one function; a
 * string return would put the blame node back in the caller, which is how a second copy starts.
 *
 * Takes `undefined` so the missing-argument case — `require()` — is answered here rather than at
 * each call site, where two callers would each place the guard somewhere different.
 *
 * NEGATIVE SPACE: a template WITH a substitution names a family of modules and gets `undefined`
 * rather than its literal prefix. A non-string literal — `require(0)` — names no module. A quasi
 * whose `cooked` is null cannot be reached: an invalid escape is a SyntaxError outside a tagged
 * template, and a tagged template is not a `TemplateLiteral`. It is refused rather than trusted.
 *
 * All three refusals are pinned, and from both sides — `boundary/import-policy` for the visitor half
 * and `style/no-raw-primitives` for the `runtimeImportSpecifier` half. The non-string one is not
 * merely a type narrow: force it through with a cast and `require(0)` hands every consumer a NUMBER
 * as its specifier, which dies in the first rule to call `.split` on it. It decides what this
 * module finds, so it is fixtured like the other two, per the convention `lib/imported-names.ts`
 * states.
