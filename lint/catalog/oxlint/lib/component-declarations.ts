// Shared reading of exported component declarations, for the three `react` rules that count
// something per component: `prop-count`, `hook-count` and `single-component-export`.
//
// "What is a component" is one question, and three rules holding three private opinions about it
// means a declaration form one of them fails to recognise is a component that rule skips in
// silence — a clean run that checked less than it looked like it did. Answering it once here is
// what keeps them governing the same set.
//
// The forms read as one thing and are separate nodes: `export function Name()`, `export default
// function Name()`, an arrow assigned to a `const`, a `memo`/`forwardRef` binding, and the two
// spellings that export a declaration made earlier in the file — `export { Name }` and `export
// default Name`. Cover the first and the rest go unread, and the unread ones carry the smell — the
// component tucked in beside another is usually the small arrow, not the exported function
// declaration, and a file written `const Card = …; const CardRow = …; export { Card, CardRow }`
// has every component it declares in the one place a declaration-only reader never looks.
//
// The export list is resolved through oxlint's SCOPE ANALYSIS rather than by matching names
// against the file's own declarations. Not a refactor: scope analysis already knows that
// `export { Card } from "./card"` binds nothing here (so it is a re-export, not a declaration) and
// that `export { View }` naming an import is that module's component and not this file's, and both
// fall out as an unresolved or non-declaration reference rather than as arms someone has to
// remember to write.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE:
//   - `export * from "./panels"` hands on components this file never declares. Nothing about them
//     is readable here, and counting the statement as one component would be a guess at a number.
//   - `export { Card }` where the name's declaration is neither a function declaration nor a
//     declarator with an initializer — a parameter, a class, `let Card; Card = () => …`. What such
//     a name holds at export time is a data-flow question, and these rules read declarations. A
//     `let` that IS initialized with a function is read like any other declarator, reassignment
//     below it included, for the same reason.
//   - An anonymous `export default () => {}` or `export default function () {}` has no name to
//     report and no name to grep for, which is a different complaint than any of these three rules
//     makes.
//
// ── Adapt ──
// `WRAPPER_NAMES` names the higher-order components whose argument is the real component. Add a
// project's own wrapper (`observer` from mobx, a `withTheme`) if components arrive through it.
