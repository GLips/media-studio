/**
 * Holds a rule's diagnostics until `Program:exit` and emits them in source order.
 *
 * oxlint emits diagnostics in the order a rule reports them, and a rule with both traversal-time
 * arms and a whole-file arm reports them in neither source nor any other legible order: everything
 * the whole-file arm finds lands after everything the traversal found, however early in the file it
 * sits. A rule that fences imported names has both by construction — scope analysis answers about
 * the whole file, and the spellings that bind no name are only visible mid-traversal.
 *
 * ONE OWNER. Every arm of a rule that uses this must report through it, including the arms that run
 * during traversal and would be in order on their own. Half a rule buffering is the case that
 * produces the scrambled output above, and it is the shape this module exists to make unwritable.
 *
 * NO FIXTURE CAN PIN THIS, and none can be written: `RuleTester` sorts a rule's diagnostics by span
 * before comparing them, so under the harness the order is correct whether this module runs or not.
 * Delete it and `bun run check` stays green. Verify it against the oxlint CLI by hand after any
 * change to it.
 *
 * A harness pass that runs the CLI and asserts report order was proposed and DISMISSED. Do not wait
 * for one: report order is cosmetic, so that pass would cost a second CLI run over the whole catalog
 * to assert the one property here that no reader can act on wrongly.
 *
 * NEGATIVE SPACE: `loc`-only diagnostics are not accepted. Sorting needs a span, and every rule in
 * the catalog blames a node.
