/**
 * One owner for "does this specifier name a unit's server barrel", read by both `api/` rules.
 *
 * They held a copy each and the copies had already drifted: `api/barrel-direction` accepted a bare
 * `index.server`, `api/server-import-context` required a preceding `/`, and nothing said which
 * answer was intended. The bare form wins. Under a `baseUrl`-style resolution it IS the source
 * root's own server barrel, and a published package named `index.server` is not a thing; letting
 * one rule see a spelling the other cannot is how the pair stopped agreeing in the first place.
 *
 * NEGATIVE SPACE: the specifier is matched as TEXT, so a folded path
 * (`../billing/../audit/index.server`) reaches this unfolded and the last segment decides. Folding
 * is `policy/layout.ts`'s `classifySpecifier`, and every raw text matcher in the catalog is a
 * candidate to move onto it — for `api/`, that move lands in this module alone rather than in two
 * rules that have to agree afterwards.
