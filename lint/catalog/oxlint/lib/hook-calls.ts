// The one answer to "which React hook does this call name", for the sites in `react/` that ask it:
// `hook-count` counts every hook call and `no-async-effect` watches `useEffect` and `useCallback`.
//
// A copy of the question per caller is an answer per caller, and the disagreement is not exotic —
// it is `React.useEffect`. A `hook-count` that counts the namespaced spelling, beside an
// `error`-severity rule reading `Identifier` only and silent on it, leaves a file with `React.`
// on every hook drawing a warning about hook volume and nothing about the async effect inside it.
// A rule that reports the whole file except the one line that matters is worse than one that
// reports nothing, because the clean half certifies the missing half.
//
// THE HOOK'S NAME IS THE EXPORTING MODULE'S, not the local one. `import { useEffect as useE }`
// calls `useEffect`, and `import { createStore as useStore }` does not call a hook however the
// local spelling reads. That is `lib/imported-names.ts`'s rule — "the fence is on what the module
// hands over, not on what this file decided to call it" — held here so the react tier and the name
// fences answer the aliasing question the same way. A private `/^use[A-Z]/` in `hook-count` matches
// `useE` by accident of the letter after `use` while the other three match it not at all: three
// behaviours for one question, none of them decided.
//
// NEGATIVE SPACE, each a spelling that calls a hook and is reported by nobody:
//   - A member read whose key is not statically known: `React[hookName]()`. `staticKeyName` owns
//     that refusal, and there is no name to compare against.
//   - A hook reached through a local binding rather than a call: `const fx = useEffect; fx(…)`.
//     Following an assignment is a data-flow question, and the four rules here read one file.
//   - A member read whose key is aliased on the OTHER side: `hooks.effect(…)` re-exported from a
//     local module as React's `useEffect`. Only the property name is available here, and following
//     it means opening another file.
//   - The default-imported hook, in both its spellings: `import useAuth from "./use-auth"` and
//     `import { default as useAuth } from "./use-auth"`. A default export has no name of its own,
//     so the local spelling is all there is and it is what gets used. The second spelling wears a
//     named specifier's node shape and is NOT a module export called "default" —
//     `lib/imported-names.ts` decides it the same way, and two owners disagreeing about one
//     spelling is the defect this file exists to remove.
//
// The OBJECT of a member read is deliberately not checked: `React.useEffect`, `ReactDOM.useEffect`
// and `whatever.useEffect` are all read as `useEffect`. Requiring the object to be React means
// deciding what React is called in this file, which is a second import question with its own
// aliasing, and the over-match it prevents — an unrelated object with a method named `use[A-Z]` —
// is not a shape anyone writes.
